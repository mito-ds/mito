# Pivot Tables

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/71ZePOAIhzc" %}

To create a pivot table, click on the **pivot table** icon in the Mito toolbar and then use the task pane to configure it.&#x20;

To configure the pivot table:

* First, use the rows section to select construct a key to group the data frame by
* Then, if you want to further stratify the groups into individual cells, use the columns section
* Finally,  use the values section to decide how to aggregate the data within those buckets. You can switch aggregation methods using the dropdown that defaults to the 'count' aggregation.
* To edit a pivot table you have configured, click the pivot button again and the menu will reappear.&#x20;
