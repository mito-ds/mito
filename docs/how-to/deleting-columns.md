Mito supports deleting columns one at a time, or multiple at once! Just select the columns you want to delete and then press the **delete key** on your keyboard or the **delete column** button in the Mito toolbar. To select multiple columns at once:

If you're using Windows:
* `shift + click` to select every column in between your previous selected column and the column you clicked on.
* `control + click` to add the column you just clicked on to your selection.

If you're using Mac: 
* `shift + click` to select every column in between your previous selected column and the column you clicked on.
* `cmd + click` to add the column you just clicked on to your selection.
