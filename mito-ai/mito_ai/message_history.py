class GlobalMessageHistory:
    """
    Manages a global message history with thread-safe access and persistence.

    This class ensures thread-safe operations for reading, writing, and 
    modifying message histories using a Lock object. It supports loading 
    from and saving to disk, appending new messages, clearing histories, 
    and truncating histories. The histories are stored on disk for persistence.

    Thread safety is crucial to prevent data corruption and race conditions 
    when multiple threads access or modify the message histories concurrently.

    We store two types of messages: AI-optimized and display-optimized messages.
    We store display_history to be able to restore them in the frontend when 
    the extension loads. We store ai_optimized_history to keep the conversation context
    for continuing the conversation.

    The JSON file structure for storing the histories is as follows:
    {
      "chat_history_version": 1,
      "ai_optimized_history": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "..."
        },
        {
          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "..."
        }
      ],
      "display_history": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "..."
        },
        {
          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "..."
        }
      ]
    }

    JSON schema is chosen to match what is stored in the memory, so it is 
    easy to serialize/deserialize.

    Attributes:
        _lock (Lock): Ensures thread-safe access.
        _ai_optimized_history (List[Dict[str, str]]): Stores LLM messages.
        _display_history (List[Dict[str, str]]): Stores display messages.
        _save_file (str): Path to the file where histories are saved.

    Methods:
        get_histories() -> tuple[List[Dict[str, str]], List[Dict[str, str]]]:
            Returns copies of the LLM and display histories.
        clear_histories() -> None:
            Clears both histories and saves the changes to disk.
        append_message(ai_optimized_message: Dict[str, str], display_message: Dict[str, str]) -> None:
            Appends new messages to the histories and saves to disk.
        truncate_histories(index: int) -> None:
            Truncates both histories at the given index and saves to disk.
