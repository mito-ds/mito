<Example 1>
Files in the current directory:
file_name: sales.csv

Defined Variables:
{{
    'revenue_multiplier': 1.5,
    'sales_df': pd.DataFrame({{
        'transaction_date': ['2024-01-02', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-03'],
        'price_per_unit': [10, 9.99, 13.99, 21.00, 100],
        'units_sold': [1, 2, 1, 4, 5],
        'total_price': [10, 19.98, 13.99, 84.00, 500]
    }})
}}

Code in active cell:
```python
import pandas as pd
sales_df = pd.read_csv('./sales.csv')
revenue_multiplier =  1.5
sales_df['total_revenue'] = sales_df['price'] * revenue_multiplier
```

Error Traceback:
Cell In[24], line 4
      1 import pandas as pd
      2 sales_df = pd.read_csv('./sales.csv')
      3 revenue_multiplier =  1.5
----> 4 sales_df['total_revenue'] = sales_df['price'] * revenue_multiplier

KeyError: 'price'


ERROR ANALYSIS:
Runtime error: Attempted to access non-existent DataFrame column

INTENT ANALYSIS:
User is trying to calculate total revenue by applying a multiplier to transaction prices. Based on the defined variables, the column that the user is tring to access is likely `total_price` because that would allow them to calculate the total revenue for each transaction.

SOLUTION:
```python
import pandas as pd
sales_df = pd.read_csv('./sales.csv')
revenue_multiplier =  1.5
sales_df['total_revenue'] = sales_df['total_price'] * revenue_multiplier
```

The DataFrame contains 'total_price' rather than 'price'. Updated column reference to match existing data structure.
</Example 1>

<Example 2>
Files in the current directory:


Defined Variables:
{{
    'df': pd.DataFrame({{
        'order_id': [1, 2, 3, 4],
        'date': ['Mar 7, 2025', 'Sep 24, 2024', '25 June, 2024', 'June 29, 2024'],
        'amount': [100, 150, 299, 99]
    }})
}}

Code in active cell:
```python
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
```

Error Traceback:
Cell In[27], line 1
----> 1 df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

ValueError: time data "25 June, 2024" doesn't match format "%b %d, %Y", at position 2. You might want to try:
    - passing `format` if your strings have a consistent format;
    - passing `format='ISO8601'` if your strings are all ISO8601 but not necessarily in exactly the same format;
    - passing `format='mixed'`, and the format will be inferred for each element individually. You might want to use `dayfirst` alongside this.

ERROR ANALYSIS:
This is a ValueError caused by applying the wrong format to a specific date string. Because it was triggered at position 2, the first date string must have successfully converted. By looking at the defined variables, I can see that first date string is in the format "Mar 7, 2025", but the third date string is in the format "25 June, 2024". Those dates are not in the same format, so the conversion failed.

INTENT ANALYSIS:
User is trying to convert the date column to a datetime object even though the dates are not in the same starting format. 

SOLUTION:
```python
def parse_date(date_str):
    formats = ['%b %d, %Y', '%d %B, %Y']
    
    for fmt in formats:
        try:
            return pd.to_datetime(date_str, format=fmt)
        except ValueError:
            # Try the next format
            continue
            
    # If no format worked, return Not a Time
    return pd.NaT

df['date'] = df['date'].apply(lambda x: parse_date(x))
```

Since the dates are not in a consistent format, we need to first figure out which format to use for each date string and then use that format to convert the date.

The best way to do this is with a function. We can call this function `parse_date`.

Guidelines for Solutions:

Error Analysis:

- Identify error type (Syntax, Runtime, Logic).
- Use the defined variables and code in the active cell to understand the error.
- Consider kernel state and execution order

Intent Preservation:

- Try to understand the user's intent using the defined variables and code in the active cell.

Solution Requirements:

- Return the full code cell with the error fixed and a short explanation of the error.
- Only update code in the active cell. Do not update other code in the notebook.
- Propose a solution that fixes the error and does not change the user's intent.
- Make the solution as simple as possible.
- Reuse as much of the existing code as possible.
- Do not add temporary comments like '# Fixed the typo here' or '# Added this line to fix the error'
- The code in the SOLUTION section should be a python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```

Here is your task.
