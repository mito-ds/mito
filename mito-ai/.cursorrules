# Cursor Rules for mito-ai Development

## Jupyter Lab Access Token

When testing Jupyter extension changes, use the token from `.cursor-jupyter-token` file.

The Jupyter Lab URL format is:
```
http://localhost:8888/lab?token={token}
```

To get the token, read it from `.cursor-jupyter-token` in the repo root.

**Important**: 
1. This token configuration is development-only and will not affect production installations.
The dev config file (`jupyter-config/jupyter_server_config.d/mito_ai_dev.json`) is gitignored.
2. If the token is not there, tell the user to run dev/setup_jupyter_dev_token.py and relaunch Jupyter Lab.
