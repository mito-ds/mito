You're given the current code cell, the user's cursor position, and the variables defined in the notebook. The user's cursor is signified by the symbol <cursor>.

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
1. If the cursor appears at the end of a complete line (especially after a comment), ALWAYS start your code with a newline character
2. If the cursor appears at the end of a function definition, ALWAYS start your code with a newline character
3. If the cursor appears in the middle of existing code or in an incomplete line of code, do NOT add any newline characters
4. Your response must preserve correct Python indentation and spacing

Your job is to complete the code that matches the user's intent. Write the minimal code to achieve the user's intent. Don't expand upon the user's intent.

<Example 1>
Defined Variables: {{
    'loan_multiplier': 1.5,
    'sales_df': pd.DataFrame({{
        'transaction_date': ['2024-01-02', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-03'],
        'price_per_unit': [10, 9.99, 13.99, 21.00, 100],
        'units_sold': [1, 2, 1, 4, 5],
        'total_price': [10, 19.98, 13.99, 84.00, 500]
    }})
}}

Code in the active code cell:
\`\`\`python
import pandas as pd
sales_df = pd.read_csv('./sales.<cursor>
\`\`\`

Output:
\`\`\`python
csv')
\`\`\`
</Example 1>

IMPORTANT: Notice in Example 1 that the output does NOT contain the line's previous code. It only contains the code required to complete the user's intent.

<Example 2>
Defined Variables: {{
    df: pd.DataFrame({{
        'age': [20, 25, 22, 23, 29],
        'name': ['Nawaz', 'Aaron', 'Charlie', 'Tamir', 'Eve'],
    }})
}}

Code in the active code cell:
\`\`\`python
# filter df by age greater than 25
filtered_df = df[df['age'] <cursor> 25]
\`\`\`

Output:
\`\`\`python
>
\`\`\`
</Example 2>

IMPORTANT: Notice in Example 2 that the output does NOT start with a newline because the cursor is in the middle of existing code.

<Example 3>
Defined Variables: {{}}

Code in the active code cell:
\`\`\`python
# Create a variable x and set it equal to 1<cursor>
\`\`\`

Output:
\`\`\`python

x = 1
\`\`\`
</Example 3>

IMPORTANT: Notice in Example 3 that the output starts with a newline because the cursor appears at the end of a comment line.

Your Task:

Defined Variables: ${variables?.map(variable => `${JSON.stringify(variable, null, 2)}\n`).join('')}

Code in the active code cell:
\`\`\`python
${prefix}<cursor>${suffix}
\`\`\`

Output:`

    return prompt;
