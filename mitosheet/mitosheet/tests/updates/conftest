    This fixture reads in the original user.json file that exists before these tests are
    run, deletes it, and then recreates it at the end. This allows us to test what happens 
    when the user.json file is in various states of out of date and disrepair.

    It also turns off the sending of logging to make sure we don't generate a huge number
    of new accounts on the frontend.

    It is notably autoused for this module, which means it runs before all users tests, and
    thus makes sure that running tests do not overwrite the current user.json you have.
