    This helper function is responsible for getting the package.json that is bundled
    with the javascript code bundle inside this Python package. 

    When the package is mitosheet (aka, jlab 2), then the mitosheet/labextension folder
    contains a .tgz zip file that contains the package.json. 

    When the package is mitosheet3 (aka, jlab3), then the mitosheet/labextension folder
    contains the package.json directly (as this is the new build process!).

    Thus, this function handles each case, to make sure we can get the current version
