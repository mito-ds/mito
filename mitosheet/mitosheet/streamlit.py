# your component frontend. Everything else we do in this file is simply a

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the thing we're saying hello to. The component will display

        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    -------
    int
        The number of times the component's "Click Me" button has been clicked.
        (This is the value passed to `Streamlit.setComponentValue` on the
        frontend.)
