/**
 * This is the function that makes sure that Plotly is loaded in a global
 * scope. It takes a bit of a complicated approach to get here. 
 * 
 * If we're in JupyterLab, we can just execute the script that loads the Plotly
 * minified code. This is pretty easy. 
 * 
 * If, on the other hand, we're in a Jupyter Notebook, we need to do something a 
 * little different. 
 * 
 * Namely, JNotebooks Extensions are AMD modules, which means that loading scripts
 * in the standard way does not work - and if you try and use a script you'll get
 * a variety of very confusing errors. 
 * 
 * Thus, we need to take an approach that involves using requirejs, which comes
 * in the AMD context anyways.
