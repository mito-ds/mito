Comment,3,ek0a3jp,,0,1554303456.0,"Measles has never been eliminated. There have been cases every year since the introduction of the vaccine. Numbers vary by year. In 1982, there were 1,697 reported cases of measles in the US and public health officials stated that elimination was around the corner. Then a resurgence occurred between 1989-1991 with over 53,000 cases.  As a result of this increase, children were required to get a second dose of the vaccine. 

In the year 2000, when the US declared it ""eradicated,"" there were still 86 cases of measles. 

Then take into account vaccine strain virus shedding after MMR. Reports of throat, blood, and urine samples all testing positive for vaccine strain measles infection up to 5 weeks from vaccination.

Can measles truly be eliminated if the live virus continues to be injected into the population with vaccines?

&#x200B;

And since you sent me a study discussing MMR, thimerosal and autism. Here's a link to a hidden CDC study of vaccinated vs unvaccinated. It compares children receiving the thimerosal containing Hepatitis B vaccine during the first month of life. The results of this study were never released by the CDC and an abstract was only obtained under FOIA request. 

Children vaccinated with Hepatitis B vaccine in the first month of life compared to children receiving no vaccines in the first month of life had an increased risk of 762% for autism, 829% for ADHD, 638% for ADD, 565% for tics, 498% for sleep disorders, and 206% for speech delays.

>Then take into account vaccine strain virus shedding after MMR. Reports of throat, blood, and urine samples all testing positive for vaccine strain measles infection up to 5 weeks from vaccination.

Vaccine strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting situations.

>During the 2015 California measles outbreak, many suspected cases actually occurred in persons who were recently vaccinated.

[Wrong](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm?s_cid=mm6406a5_w):

>>Among the 110 California patients, 49 (45%) were unvaccinated; five (5%) had 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine, seven (6%) had 2 doses, one (1%) had 3 doses, 47 (43%) had unknown or undocumented vaccination status, and one (1%) had immunoglobulin G seropositivity documented, which indicates prior vaccination or measles infection at an undetermined time.

Which is entirely consistent with vaccination efficacy.

>194 measles virus sequences were collected in 2015, with 73 cases found to have actually been vaccine strain measles.

Wrong again:

>>The source of the initial Disney theme park exposure has not been identified. Specimens from 30 California patients were genotyped; all were measles genotype B3, which has caused a large outbreak recently in the Philippines, but has also been detected in at least 14 countries and at least six U.S. states in the last 6 months (1).

Vaccine strain is not capable of causing wild-type disease.

>2011 New York, report of 88 person measles outbreak started by a twice-vaccinated individual.

Wow, let's hope this isn't a common occurrence. From your source:

>Here is an explanation of how I calculated the measles death rate (including the 1 in 250 estimate) 

Great, let's break that down.

>CDC lists a death rate up to 1 in 500, but mentions that before the vaccine there were thought to be 3-4 million cases and 500 deaths each year, which would be a 1 in 6,000-8,000 death rate 

There are three incongruous parts meshed together with one bad assumption:

1) The mortality rate of measles is ""up to 1:500""

2) Pre-1963, there were an estimated 3-4 million cases of measles annually

3) Pre-1963, there were 500 deaths annually

For the third point, this is, according to the CDC source, from reported measles deaths. This is not an estimate, it is an average value of actual, reported cases. This is true for pre-1963 era.

For the second, this is an estimate of the total measles morbidity annually prior to 1963. This is probably accurate for pre-1963 era, but comes loaded with a 25-33% error range, not including a particular confidence interval. 

For the first, the mortality rate is based on data from both before 1963 and after. This is derived from confirmed measles cases and confirmed measles deaths. Nuance is lost in the first point since you've lost the range, which is 1-2 per 1000. Additionally, this value is reported in an intuitive way (X per 1000) rather than the more scientifically meaningful way, a decimal number (2.0 per 1000; 0.63 per 1000). You can make the denominator increase or decrease 'large' amounts for relatively small movements in actual case fatality rates and with no or little meaningful statistical resolution between the two. 

And to belabor the point I've already made, you are comparing **estimated** morbidity with **known** mortality. That is apples to oranges. If you had an estimate of morbidity with an estimate of mortality, you could have at it. What's interesting, then, is that to get your 1:250 number you compare **known** cases with **known** mortality, not estimates. And this is further massaged by picking, presumably arbitrarily, 1994-2014. If we, also arbitrarily, include up to 1988 then we get a CFR of 0.0022 or roughly 1:450. If we just look at the outbreak of 1989-1991 we also get a CFR of 0.0022. If we just take the first five years of reported values starting at 1950--which has a combined 40 times case numbers than the entirety of 1988 onward--we get a CFR of 0.001 or roughly 1:970. Which rounds out a nice estimate of 0.001-0.002 or 1-2 per 1000. 

And yet in the first paragraph you have picked a *single range*--with no mind for data collection, statistical confidence, attack rate by age, or other extrapolation issues--while ignoring the repeatedly collected and congruent information which suggests this homebrewed estimate is wrong or not informative as packaged. 

But I appreciate you explaining how you calculated it. Vaxfact seems like a very dubious website, as an aside. I would like to repeat my caution that you stick to reputable sources.

Comment,1,ek37pd4,,0,1554397404.0,"The information I provided is not wrong. It's from a 2017 study in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. One of the co-authors is CDC Division of Viral Diseases official Rebecca J. McNall.

[Identification of Measles Virus Vaccine Genotype](https://jcm.asm.org/content/55/3/735)

McNall wrote, ""During the measles outbreak in California in 2015, a large number of suspected cases occurred in recent vaccinees. Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences."" This proves that the measles outbreak was in part caused by the vaccine.

&#x200B;

>Vaccine  strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting  situations.

McNall contradicts that by explaining that vaccine strain reaction (rash & fever) is clinically indistinguishable from the natural disease. You need genotyping to confirm the origin and distinguish vaccine strain cases from wild-type cases.

So by you saying that vaccine strain measles is only scary for the immunocompromised, and CDC stating that the reaction of vaccine strain and wild strain is identical, it proves that the general public should NOT be worried about measles. It is a mild illness to everyone but, as you said, ""those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting  situations.""

&#x200B;

Also, thank you for showing me the 2004 Thimerosal study. You've uncovered something interesting.

The 1999 study is titled *Increased Risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine in first month of life.* It states children who received the Hep B at birth had an increase of 762% for autism, 498% for sleep disorders, and 206% for speech delays compared to children that did not receive the vaccine.

The conclusion: This analysis suggests that high exposure to ethylmercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life increases the risk of subsequent development of neurologic development impairment...

&#x200B;

Oddly, the 2004 continuation study is the exact opposite. Titled *Safety of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines: A Two-Phased Study of Computerized Health Maintenance Organization Databases.*

In this ""Phase II"" study, they've re-analyzed the Phase I data and suddenly found no increased risks for autism or attention-deficit disorder.

*Conclusions.* No  consistent significant associations were found between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes. **Conflicting results were found at different  HMOs for certain outcomes. For resolving the conflicting findings,  studies with uniform neurodevelopmental assessments of children with a  range of cumulative thimerosal exposures are needed.**

&#x200B;

I have a feeling that you regard everything the CDC reports as unquestionably true. But even you might find this a bit sketchy:

\- In 1997, Congress mandated the FDA to complete a review of mercury in drugs and food.

\- In 1999, CDC conducted their study, found incredibly concerning data, and instead of making it public, they decided not to publish.

\- In 2001, the CDC removed or reduced thimerosal in all childhood vaccines because of safety concerns.

\- In 2004, they published the continuation study that suddenly found that thimerosal was safe all along. And to resolve this obvious conflict in data between Phase I & II, they suggested that more studies of children exposed to thimerosal were needed. Conveniently, thimerosal had already been removed...

Clinically indistinguishable means that when OBSERVING the patient, the PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (rash & fever) can look the same in BOTH wild strain and vaccine strain measles.  

&#x200B;

>Vaccine strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary  for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting situations.

True. They differ on a genetic level. But they share the common physical symptoms of rash & fever. You taught me that the pathogenic strain can cause further complications like SSPE. According to the CDC, severe complications are rare. Pneumonia is said to be 1 in 20. That doesn't look bad when compared to the MMR II pre-licensing studies that got released this week. The studies show 40-50% of kids got upper respiratory infections and gastro-intestinal disorders after the MMR vaccine. That's a harsh trade-off for a virus that causes rash & fever in the common person and then gives you lifelong immunity. Unless you're immunocompromised, no reason to be scared of wild measles.

&#x200B;

>Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences

&#x200B;

>Those recent vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had a  relatively common reaction to the vaccination and, due to proximity  (locale and time) with an actual measles   outbreak, were initial  false-positives.

Your argument is that these vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had the EXACT SAME PHYSICAL REACTION as the people that DID catch the measles at the SAME TIME & LOCATION of a measles outbreak? 

Maybe entertain the possibility of primary & secondary vaccine failure. Or viral shedding from other recent vaccinees. Your faith in this vaccine is strong my friend. 

&#x200B;

Now the 1999 pilot. You got this wrong. And I'm the one that doesn't know how to read? 

>More data can do that. Weird how sample sizes work?

Actually they looked at less data. The 1999 unpublished pilot looked at 400,000 infants in the VSD. Phase I of the 2004 published study only looked at 124,170 infants in the VSD. 

>Yep. Bigger sample size.

Wrong again. In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were re-evaluated among only 16,717 children.

It's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant. Then they reduced it again. Wow.  This is the same strategy Dr. William Thompson said he used with his team to bury the autism link during the famous 2004 MMR study. 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, there's a massive ethical issue with the 1999 study. If you're the CDC, and you find data that points to a 762% increase in autism after the Hep B shot, you have a duty to disclose that to the public. The CDC is the health protection agency of the nation. 

They had multiple options: 

Hold a press conference and re-assure the public that a further study would be done immediately. (This study analyzed existing data in the VSD so they could literally have done this study with a computer in a few hours). 

Remove the Hep B vaccine indefintely for non-risk newborns until further study was completed. Only administer it to at-risk newborns if their mother tested positive for Hep B during pregnancy. It is a vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease given on the first day of life. It would have made zero difference. 

Either option would would have built public trust and strengthened the vaccine program. 

Instead, they hid the study. Then 5 years later, they reduce the sample sizes and publish a study ""proving"" everything was safe all along. 

Fortunately for us, the FOIA request has exposed the unpublished 1999 pilot. Now, the CDC loses credibility, and confirms people's suspicions that it cares more about protecting pharma profits and the reputation of vaccines than children's health.

>This proves that the measles outbreak was in part caused by the vaccine.

It proves you don't know how to read. The outbreak in California was caused by the Phillipines strain as already referenced. What the paper you *just* referenced is talking about is the ability to discriminate between vaccine measles strains and pathogenic measles strains. Your source goes on to say:

>>Since approximately 5% of recipients of measles virus-containing vaccine experience rash and fever which may be indistinguishable from measles (9), it is very important to identify vaccine reactions to avoid unnecessary isolation of the patient, as well as the need for contact tracing and other labor-intensive public health interventions.

And the part you liked to leave out, because you are dishonest and in over your head:

>>Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences (R. J. McNall, unpublished data). 

>>Genotyping is used to confirm the origin of an outbreak and to exclude endemic circulation, but it is also the only way to distinguish vaccine strains from wild-type viruses. 

Those recent vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had a relatively common reaction to the vaccination and, due to proximity (locale and time) with an actual measles outbreak, were initial false-positives.

>McNall contradicts that by explaining that vaccine strain reaction (rash & fever) is clinically indistinguishable from the natural disease.

No they don't. How else, then, can the PCR test distinguish them if they are indistinguishable? How else, then, do public health authorities justify quarantine for those with measles rather than vaccination reactions? You know, like McNall says here:

>>During measles outbreak investigations, rapid detection of measles vaccine reactions is necessary to avoid unnecessary public health interventions.

And also in **the first line of the paper**:

>>During measles outbreaks, it is important to be able to rapidly distinguish between measles cases and vaccine reactions to avoid unnecessary outbreak response measures such as case isolation and contact investigations. 

>and CDC stating that the reaction of vaccine strain and wild strain is identical

They don't. Even in *your source* they are clearly distinguishable. The measles component is twice attenuated and not pathogenic. It can cause a rash and fever. It does not cause CNS damage, immune repertoire depletion, or SSPE--hallmarks of pathogenic measles. 

>Also, thank you for showing me the 2004 Thimerosal study. You've uncovered something interesting.

Going through the blood is, in fact, probably more dangerous, but the quantity is so miniscule it can be easily expelled and, even if it isn’t, it can’t cause damage to the body.

For example, it wipes out the memory of your immune cells, so you have the immune system of a newborn again and susceptible to everything you ever had before.

They didn’t have the medical advances or knowledge that we do now. The vaccine wasn’t available until 1963.

If you’re so paranoid that you refuse to believe in science that’s been widely practiced for hundreds of years and prefer to instead think that every scientist, every doctor, every nurse, every researcher, every drug company, every drug manufacturer, and every politician in the US is part of some big conspiracy because you have some sEcReT iNfOrMaTiOn then you A.) get a medical exemption, or B.) home school. 

It’s not that complicated. You have the right to say what you do and don’t want to put in your body, and everyone else has the right to say they don’t want to accept the risk of fringe cases who are willing to put their entire community at risk of contracting a potentially deadly and preventable disease so that they don’t have to get a shot that the other 99.9% of people are fine with. It’s a matter of personal responsibility, and your rights end at the tip of everyone else’s nose. 

But this idea that “They” are pushing to make the vaccine mandatory is laughable to anyone who doesn’t get all their information from Instagram wellness influencers or YouTube videos of guys in MAGA hats screaming in their trucks.

Comment,1,elnv8rx,,0,1556119082.0,"> recipients of measles virus-containing vaccine EXPERIENCE RASH AND FEVER which may be INDISTINGUISHABLE from measles

The rash and fever are not the total of the measles pathology. Literally the entire point of the paper you cite is to distinguish in a rapid way wild type pathogenic measles from reactions to MMR. It is literally the justification for their assay, funding, and paper that MMR does not and cannot cause wild-type measles pathology. *Some* aspects make the distinction difficult. Try as you might, they are not equivalent and your source makes that clear.

>Clinically indistinguishable means that when OBSERVING the patient, the PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (rash & fever) can look the same in BOTH wild strain and vaccine strain measles.

Yes the FEVER and the RASH can BOTH be SIMILAR in wild type MEASLES or a REACTION to the MEASLES component of the MMR VACCINE. NOWHERE do the AUTHORS suggest THAT wild-type measles IS clinically identical IN consequence TO the measles VACCINE component. 

>True. They differ on a genetic level. But they share the common physical symptoms of rash & fever.

And they also don't share other pathologies, hence the distinction being important from a public heath standpoint. You keep ignoring this.

>You taught me that the pathogenic strain can cause further complications like SSPE. According to the CDC, severe complications are rare. Pneumonia is said to be 1 in 20.

Death is about 1-2 per 1000 for wild-type measles, as well as immune repertoire depletion, deafness, pneumonia you mention, encephahlitis you mention. This doesn't happen with the vaccine component.

>The studies show 40-50% of kids got upper respiratory infections and gastro-intestinal disorders after the MMR vaccine.

Link it if you want me to consider it in our discussion.

>That's a harsh trade-off for a virus that causes rash & fever in the common person

And would kill thousands annually unnecessarily, along with the sequelae we've mentioned previously. But, sure, let's equate increased risk of a cold with measles pathology.

>and then gives you lifelong immunity.

You can get lifelong immunity *and* avoid the disease with vaccines. Immunity isn't the goal--avoiding the disease and its ramifications is.

>Unless you're immunocompromised, no reason to be scared of wild measles.

We've literally mentioned excellent reasons, such as the unnecessary deaths of thousands and other bad sequelae. All of which has disappeared from the US due to vaccination. 

>Your argument is that these vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had the EXACT SAME PHYSICAL REACTION as the people that DID catch the measles at the SAME TIME & LOCATION of a measles outbreak?

That's not my argument--that's what your study says. They didn't have the exact same physical reaction, they had a fever and rash. They were not shedding measles virus, they were potentially shedding attenuated measles vaccine virus. They were not having a risk of pneumonia, encephalitis, or death. They were having an uncommon reaction to the vaccine strain.

>Maybe entertain the possibility of primary & secondary vaccine failure. Or viral shedding from other recent vaccinees. Your faith in this vaccine is strong my friend.

Vaccination failure exists. The solution is to titer and re-vaccinate, or rely on herd immunity.

As for shedding from recent vaccinees, they'd be shedding attenuated vaccine virus. Which, again, is not pathogenic.

There's no faith at play here.

>Now the 1999 pilot. You got this wrong. And I'm the one that doesn't know how to read?

Either unable or unwilling, yes.

>Actually they looked at less data. The 1999 unpublished pilot looked at 400,000 infants in the VSD. Phase I of the 2004 published study only looked at 124,170 infants in the VSD.

Ah, here's that inability to read again. Let's fact check this bit.

>>We assessed the risk for neurologic and renal impairment associated with past exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine using automated data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). VSD is a large linked database from four health maintenance organizations in Washington, Oregon and California, containing immunization, medical visit and demographic data on over 400,000 infants born between '91 and '97.

There are 400,000 infants in the VSD. That doesn't mean all were appropriate or selected for in their analysis. So you're already off base here. But it gets better.

>>A 2-phased retrospective cohort study was
conducted using computerized health maintenance organization (HMO) databases. Phase I screened for associations between neurodevelopmental disorders and thimerosal exposure among 124 170 infants who were born during
1992 to 1999 at 2 HMOs (A and B). In phase II, the most
common disorders associated with exposure in phase I
were reevaluated among 16 717 children who were born
during 1991 to 1997 in another HMO (C). Relative risks
for neurodevelopmental disorders were calculated per
increase of 12.5 g of estimated cumulative mercury exposure from TCVs in the first, third, and seventh months
of life

So, no, they didn't use a smaller sample size. The exact inclusion criteria of the abstract presented isn't known, since only the abstract has been saved. And, no, phase II doesn't use a smaller sample size or remove the first. It is a comparison of a different HMO investigating rates found in the first two HMOs. And there was no association. And, finally, this study (both phases) looks at the 1st, 3rd, and 7th month of life whereas the initial abstract is just about the first month.

This is also evident when you look at the sheer number of disorders found in the full paper's phase I as it clearly outnumbers the total of all disorders of the abstract. 

So my advice: work on that reading comprehension. You've got some words down, but the ability to interpret meaning is tripping you up.

>Wrong again. In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were re-evaluated among only 16,717 children.

No, all associations and RR of significance in phase I were analyzed at a different site. It's not the ""most common"" but those with apparent RR of concern.

>It's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant.

How so? The sample size of the abstract isn't known. The paper has a combined sample size of 140,887. The significance of phase I isn't removed by addition of a *smaller* sample size. That makes no sense at all. Do you not understand how that makes no sense?

>Furthermore, there's a massive ethical issue with the 1999 study. If you're the CDC, and you find data that points to a 762% increase in autism after the Hep B shot, you have a duty to disclose that to the public. The CDC is the health protection agency of the nation.

Which they investigated. And found no apparent significance at different HMOs. And recommended further study with larger samples and consistent diagnostic criteria. In no way were the results buried. 

>Instead, they hid the study. Then 5 years later, they reduce the sample sizes and publish a study ""proving"" everything was safe all along.

You're living in a fantasy land. They published the study. You (claim) to have read it yourself.

>Thanks again for turning me onto the 2004 study.

No problem. Keep hitting the books. Read them, also, but keep hitting them, too.",2019-04-24 18:18:02

Does anyone know how that could be possible? I don't believe in the myths either but I believe it was something else that she didn't notice but what could it possibly be?

So I posted in a parenting group on FB how my 18.5 week old has been quieter for the past couple of days. Nothing major I was just wondering if it's a normal part of development. 

Anyway so the majority of comments were delightful and reassuring but then I get one ""any recent vaccines""? And ""has he been vaxxed recently""? Damn I thought... Responded that yes he had a couple almost 3 weeks ago. Cue the sad reacts, angry reacts, comments ""his behaviour is definitely vaccine related"", ""you're poisoning your baby"", ""he's definitely acting weird because of the vaccines"" etc. Plus several unsolicited DMs stating how I'm poisoning and damaging my baby by vaccinating him and trying to sell me spray (I kid you not) to 'detox his skin from the metals'. Honestly I was shocked and just ignored it until people tried to do power moves ""I'm a pediatric nurse who sees this all the time in vaccinated babies"" and then I started defending myself and asking people to remain respectful and stick to the topic at hand. Tried to get some science in there (many laugh reacts in response) but I know there often futile. Honestly there were tens of people on this thread saying ""I came here to say the same thing"" etc. 

So I turn off commenting and edit to say thanks mostly to everyone but not the space for anti-vax opinion so closing comments. THEN I get a fricken message from the fricken admins saying I was being unkind by calling people OVERTLY AGAINST VACCINES anti-vaxxers and that I should either edit my post or delete it. Are you KIDDING me??? Someone literally said I was going to kill my baby and that he needs a detox (from a fricken spray bottle) and I'M being unkind?! Not to mention the thread full of misinformation and links to dodgy websites like whats in the leaflet or whatever it's called. 

Honestly I was so angry that out of all the thousands of things that could have affected my baby's behaviour some people jumped on the vaccines that he had 3 weeks ago, but that message from the admins really was the last straw - I was 'breaking the rules by being unkind' simply by defending my choice to vaccinate and asking people to remain respectful and stick to the topic. 

I'm just raging. I hate that people like this exist and I hate that there is so much distrust in the world I can't ask a simple question without it turning into some anti vax propaganda and a personal attack. I'm so worried for the future generations if kids are being brought up like this.

But then, their social conditioning overrides their intuition, molding that thing into what society wants them to think it is. Thus, they are not able to think for themselves or interpret reality correctly.

In other words, ""reality"" is what actually exists and what is actually going on, as opposed to the façade that society has placed over what actually exists and what is actually going on; nor is reality how one interprets something when in a state of psychological denial.

For example, when it comes to the government informing the public about something, most people simply assume that their government is telling them the truth. But, IN REALITY, these people have absolutely no idea what is actually going on, and do not want to admit such an obvious fact to themselves! In society, critical issues, such as what the government is really doing behind the scenes, are simply blown off as being non-issues. Very convenient indeed.",2021-06-22 00:31:26

"Sobre las vacunas para el COVID19, compilación de textos científicos y opinión personal.",6,lace91,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/lace91/sobre_las_vacunas_para_el_covid19_compilación_de/,1,1612209373.0,"A propósito de los comentarios que he leído y escuchado sobre las vacunas para el COVID19, pero sobre todo de la vacuna rusa Sputnik V, me he dado a la tarea de estudiar algunos textos científicos y hacer una compilación de los mismos para hacerlos de su conocimiento, a continuación les comparto

**SOBRE LA VACUNA RUSA SPUTNIK V**  
The Lancet, una de las revistas médicas más prestigiosas del mundo, publicó los resultados de los ensayos de la primera y la segunda fase de la vacuna rusa SPUTNIK V, que demostraron lo siguiente:

1. La plataforma de vectores adenovirales humanos es eficaz, a pesar de las preocupaciones por la posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente a los adenovirus.

2. Se seleccionó la dosis segura óptima que permitió lograr una respuesta inmunitaria humoral y celular en el 100 % de los participantes, incluso en aquellos que habían tenido una infección con adenovirus.

3. El uso de dos vectores diferentes permite lograr una respuesta inmune más efectiva.

4. El nivel de anticuerpos contra el SARS-CoV-2 en voluntarios vacunados con Sputnik V fue entre 1,4 y 1,5 veces más alto que el nivel de anticuerpos en los pacientes que se habían recuperado del covid-19.

5. Tiene una eficacia de 91.4 por ciento contra el virus SARS-CoV-2, y de 100 por ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de la enfermedad Covid-19.

Al mismo tiempo, no se encontraron eventos adversos graves en los vacunados con Sputnik V, mientras que para otras vacunas, este parámetro oscila entre el 1 y el 25 por ciento.

Varias otras empresas están utilizando también plataformas basadas en vectores adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas contra el covid-19, como por ejemplo Johnson & Johnson, que usa el vector Ad26, y la china CanSino, que emplea el Ad5 mientras que la Rusa SPUTNIK V utiliza dos vectores adenovirales, el Ad5 y el Ad26.

Vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros países, como el vector de adenovirus de chimpancé (OXFORD-ASTRA ZENECA, quienes por cierto están estudiando la posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su vacuna y la SPUTNIK V para incrementar su efectividad) o la tecnología de ARN (PFIZER-BIONTECH), nunca antes habían sido utilizadas en vacunas que hayan pasado la FASE 3. Tampoco han sido sometidas a estudios a largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios en el cuerpo humano, como por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con el cáncer o sus efectos sobre la fertilidad.

**Las vacunas de ARN mensajero (PFIZER-BIONTECH-MODERNA).**  
La mayor preocupación con este tipo de vacunas ha sido su inestabilidad, su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en las células y que expresen el antígeno. También ha preocupado el hecho de que el ARN puede estimular reacciones inmunológicas de tipo inflamatorio, por lo que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo. El ARN es una molécula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas (de menos 80℃), se degrada muy fácilmente por enzimas y no se internaliza de forma eficiente.

Sin embargo, esta tecnología también tiene ventajas. Es relativamente más barata que otro tipo de vacunas y, sobre todo, permite diseñar una vacuna nueva en un tiempo récord. Una vez que se conoce el genoma del patógeno, en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales, lo que la convierte en una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un patógeno nuevo para el que se necesita una vacuna con urgencia, como en una pandemia. En este caso, la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad. Moderna fue capaz de diseñar su vacuna de ARNm contra SARS-CoV-2 tan solo seis semanas después de que el genoma del virus se hiciera público.

**MI OPINIÓN.**  
Por un lado la vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de vacunas ya probados, innova en el sentido de usar dos vectores en lugar de uno solo. Es un modelo que, si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en las vacunas de ARN mensajero, es más segura en términos de efectos secundarios adversos e igual de efectiva que la vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora y que nos hemos aplicado.

Por el otro lado Pfizer y otras le apuestan al futuro y a lo económico, puede que en esta ocasión tengan tropezones pero el avance que van a lograr es un ahorro en años de investigación, aún así, como el resto de las vacunas, el reto será que en el mediano y largo plazo resulten eficaces y que sus efectos adversos sean mínimos para poder compararlas con el modelo tradicional de vacunas que, guste o no a políticos y villamelones, es eficaz y seguro.

**¿CONCLUSIÓN?**  
Me encuentro optimista, las vacunas contra el COVID19 comentadas en este texto han demostrado científicamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver y prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias. La competencia entre científicos es sana y provoca desarrollos alternativos, lo que nos permite tener varias respuestas a un mismo problema y con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que, de acuerdo a cada país, pueden ser más adecuadas para cada uno.

If an antivaxer is attacking you or making baseless/outlandish + unscientific claims, you can use this list of information to shut their arguments down immediately with facts:

\-**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.

\-Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported. It is estimated by a Harvard study using data mining technology + VAERS reports that **adverse events are reported at 100x** (or more) the **rate that they actually occur.**

\-One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects** (like the placebo effect, people believe/imagine they are having symptoms due to fear/expectation)

\-Not **a single case of autism** has ever made it to higher courts, because the **autism + vaccine connection has an overwhelming amount of research debunking it.**

\-in 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability** for their product to reassure the public of safety: this is because research has proven without doubt that vaccines are **incredibly safe.** Despite manufacture liability, vaccine manufactures have never actually needed to pay out any amount for any purported ""injury"" claims. The evidence is overwhelming to **debunk these claims.**

\-**Andrew Wakefield,** a public disgrace and conspiracist theorist with multiple agendas, is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**. His paper was later **retracted for fraud** and his licence **revoked**.

\-**Vaccine inserts** list events that occur normally in populations and **do NOT prove any causative association** between vaccines and these purported ""events"". If the events listed in vaccine inserts actually \*caused\* these effects, billions in personal injury lawsuits would be paid out --> which is *not* the case!

\-Unlike what antivaxers claim, it has been proven thoroughly that Gardasil is incredibly safe. The supposed ""injuries"" that circulate the internet in the form of horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of mass psychogenic events, instigated by fear + the nocebo effect.

\-The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals, even at doses higher than used in humans.

\-The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and thoroughly investigated for safety, and no issues have been found.

\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no issues have been found.

\-Despite some ethical concerns raised, several vaccinated vs. unvaccinated studies have been conducted. It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.

\-Vaccines are thought to have a potential neuroprotective and anti-cancer effect, which is still being studied. It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer, although further investigation is needed.

\-All clinical trials for vaccines use double-blinded trials with saline placebos, which is the gold standard in medical research.

\-The FDA has an independent taxpayer-funded committee to examine and analyze all raw data from vaccine clinical trials. Scientists and data analysts conducting this research have extensive background testing to ensure no conflicts of interest in any pharmaceutical company. This debunks the myth of ""conflict of interest"" regarding vaccine manufacturers funding their own safety studies for FDA/CDC approval.

\-There are comprehensive laws to prevent the myth of the “revolving door” phenomenon that anti-vaxers like to use as proof of government-pharmaceutical corruption. If a scientist/researcher who investigated vaccine safety has had any financial ties to a pharmaceutical company, they are disqualified from the vaccine approval committee. Similarly, once an individual has worked in the field of vaccine approval for the FDA/CDC, they are unable to accept positions as pharmaceutical-hired scientists. These laws prevent conflicts of interest between vaccine approval and pharmaceutical profit.

\-Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.

\-The USA has very high vaccination rates as well as one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in all developed nations.

\-France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed countries of similar socioeconomic structure.

\-Autism is “more prevalent” due to more advanced and specific diagnostic criteria. Once diagnostic criteria was established, people of older generations (age 50’s-80’s) were found to have nearly identical rates of autism to those of younger generations (age 40’s and under).

They closed the one shot trial but have a 2 shot trial still open so my wife got in that one and her first shot is in a few days so I’m hoping she gets the vaccine also and not the placebo.  

I looked at it as a way to get a vaccine earlier and it worked.  But if I got the placebo, they said we would get the vaccine once it is approved so again I would’ve gotten it earlier.  Or I could take another vaccine if one became available.

My goal was to avoid catching COVID and get a vaccine.

So these phase 3 trials from J&J and other companies are a way to get a chance to get a vaccine early.",2021-01-12 04:59:22

Why are the world’s top vaccine promoters frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine?,0,g1zp4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/g1zp4n/why_are_the_worlds_top_vaccine_promoters/,1,1586981420.0,"From:

[https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/heres-why-bill-gates-wants-indemnity-are-you-willing-to-take-the-risk/](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/heres-why-bill-gates-wants-indemnity-are-you-willing-to-take-the-risk/)

&#x200B;

Why are the world’s top vaccine promoters, like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez, frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine?

Scientists first attempted to [develop coronavirus vaccines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382) after China’s 2002 SARS-CoV outbreak. Teams of US & foreign scientists vaccinated animals with the four most promising vaccines. At first, the experiment seemed successful as all the animals developed a robust antibody response to coronavirus. However, when the scientists exposed the vaccinated animals to the wild virus, the results were horrifying. Vaccinated animals [suffered hyper-immune responses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382) including inflammation throughout their bodies, especially in their lungs. Researchers had seen this same “enhanced immune response” during human testing of the [failed RSV vaccine tests](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189) in the 1960s. [Two children died](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189).

In this video footage, Offit, Hotez and even Anthony Fauci (in an unguarded moment), warn that any new coronavirus vaccine could trigger lethal immune reactions “vaccine enhancement” when vaccinated people come in contact with the wild virus. Instead of proceeding with caution, Fauci has made the reckless choice to [fast track](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005666/en/Moderna-Announces-Participant-Dosed-NIH-led-Phase-1) vaccines, partially [funded by Gates](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/bill-gates-says-foundation-will-invest-billions-fight-stop-covid-19/MMAFTSVGKZHPTEGYKEQKMRWTWU/), without critical [animal studies](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/researchers-rush-to-start-moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-without-usual-animal-testing/) before moving into human clinical trials that could provide early warning of runaway immune response.

Gates (in the video) is so worried about the danger of adverse events that he says vaccines shouldn’t be distributed until governments [agree to indemnity](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/09/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-on-past-pandemic-warnings.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail&fbclid=IwAR0RG79OtbdXUpY_ylULT6sY_Xo5D-cBQ0awSo6vGS19VnLGqB9z)against lawsuits. On February 4, 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html), there were only [11 active CV cases](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) in the USA, yet the U.S. quietly pushed through [Federal regulations](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/COVID19.aspx) giving coronavirus vaccine makers full immunity from liability.

I am pregnant but had them as a kid, am i protected?



Arent your risk of getting shingles greatly increased if you have had the chicken pox?



If anti vaxxers get excited that your body builds natural immunity after having the disease, isnt that what vaccines do for your body except your never ""sick""?

I'm asking in this place bc I don't know where to start.
First of all I have 2 boys one is 6 (I stopped following the schedule of vaccination) the other is 6 months (never vaccinated).
Please excuse my English.
BEFORE you jump with your outraged let me clarify why I'm doing this PERHAPS I'm wrong, people won't realized many ""anti-vaxxers"" are just normal parents unsure of what is the right thing to do and they just don't trust institution for good reasons but  all of them are being ridiculized with memes for example, this type of behavior reminds me discussions from circumcised people (supposedly an advantageous practice) fluoride in the water (recently scientifically proven to reduce iq in children), the supposed benefits of Masturbation and porn consumption when I personally have a life changing experience with NOFAP while when you Google Masturbation first page shows articles from the Huffpos, Bustler etc..about the wonders of said habit.

Add this my own personal experience and people I know irl, in my quest for knowledge I found my own vaccination schedule, I got 27 vaccines before I was 18! Mumps, chicken pox, measles included, ironically I got these 3 diseases anyway, mumps at 6, chicken pox at 19 measles at 9-10.

Even worst I'm autistic irl something I'm not proud of (I live in perpetual embarrassment) this only adds more sceptisim honestly I wanted to learn from ""both sides"" but most ""pro-vaccination"" people seems to be unconcerned individuals who only enjoy making jokes and memes about the whole subject I use to be like that until the day I was a father, I have no doubts there are people working to improve the world but let's not forget sometimes science takes a while to catch on maybe they just don't know any better the bad news pharmaceutical companies do have motives to promote vaccination just check the cost of each unit your government have to pay.",2019-09-21 03:15:01

This is how vaccines were linked to autism,11,cuzm3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/cuzm3a/this_is_how_vaccines_were_linked_to_autism/,12,1566683337.0,"It stemmed from an article published by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues back in the 1998 in the UK.

In the study, Wakefield looked at 12 children with gastrointestinal issues also had neurological deficits. Eight of those children received the MMR vaccine. He concluded the article saying they couldn't prove a connection between the MMR vaccine and the gastrointestinal issues because the evidence is inadequate. Nowhere in the article he said there was a link between autism and the vaccine, until Wakefield claimed that it did in a press conferences.

His article was published in *the Lancet*, a well-known medicinal journal, and he was known to be a prestigious and highly regarded doctor( he's the doctor who identify the cause of Crohn's disease), so when the public heard of the vaccine-autism link, the public ate it up, fear arose, and vaccination rates dropped.

The article and his claims are farfetch once you look at the detail. First, the size of his studies was too small, only 12 children, making any connection seem statistically significant. There was only a few variables were studies and according to him, those 12 children exhibited forms of autism (the symptoms were not akin to autism). Not only that, his study didn't have the Ethical Practice Committee approve the study, which is necessary to ensure that the research doesn't harm its participants.

What's worse it that it was discovered after much denial that Wakefield was being funded $800,000 by a personal injury lawyer named Richard Barr, who needed evidence that autism was caused by vaccine for cases of parents of autistic children who were suing pharmaceutical companies for compensation. Five of the 12 children were even clients of Barr. Wakefield's collaborators didn't even know about the money and were furious enough to retract their names for the study. But Wakefield had another motive. He advocated that vaccines need to be safe and tells the public that the current MMR vaccine isn't safe. Prior to his study, he was applying for a vaccine patent, he wanted to make his own MMR vaccine and wanted to get rid of the completion.

Wakefield had his medical license evoked in 2005. This should have been the end of the myth, but sadly no. He moved to the USA and is still highly regarded by people. Now his MMR and autism phase is dying down, but his new topic takes the spotlight, mercury in vaccines.",2019-08-25 00:48:57
For those concerned about thimerosal,2,cuzfzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/cuzfzp/for_those_concerned_about_thimerosal/,1,1566682500.0,"Everyone knows that mercury is harmful of the body as it is classified as a neurotoxin. So the thought of thimerosal being injected into our children and our bodies is concerning, since it does contain some mercury.

But mercury has different forms. The one that is dangerous is methylmercury. In terms of chemistry, it is the combination of a mercury atom to one carbon atom. It is known to be very dangerous to all living beings. Out of all forms of mercury, methylmercury is absorbed the easily and can even cross the blood brain barrier. Since, there are tiny tiny doses of it in contaminated food, like fish, which is why pregnant women are told to avoid seafood.

I wanted to clarify that methylmercury was never used in vaccines. While thimerosal does have mercury, it is not methylmercury. It is ethlymercury.

Ethlymercury has two carbon atoms, instead of one, which drastically changes its properties and abilities. Due to its size, it's hard for it to cross the blood brain barrier and it's quickly excreted.

Despite this, in 2002, thimerosal was removed from nearly all vaccines due to, not under the prove that it is harmful, but the idea that is has the potential for harm from the general public. This might have been due because of an article called ""Autism: A Novel Form of Mercury Poisoning"" . It was published by a group of parents in the 2001 that linked autism to mercury poisoning and the thimerosal was to blame. This article was not reviewed by any medical or scientific professionals, but it stirred up the public enough for the preservative to be removed.",2019-08-25 00:35:00

But without those preservatives, vaccines will have a very short shelf life and then afterward inefficient.  Parents may question if that's enough reason to expose their children to poison. I wanted to reassure and inform that those ingredients are harmless, despite its name and known uses, because of its dosage.

Anything in the world can act as a poison or be completely harmless depending on the dosage. So just because something sounds good or bad doesn't mean that any dosage of it remains so. For example, too much vitamin A can actually poison you and damage your liver.

Here is a list of some ingredients in vaccines and their dosage, as well as some usages:

* Aluminum hydroxide: Used as a adjuvant (helps with efficacy of vaccine) in the DTap (0.625 mg). Also used antacids and in infant formula (0.225 mg per liter).
* Formaldehyde: Prevent growth of harmful bacteria in vaccine. All vaccine combined has 1.2 mg of it, while 1 kg of bananas has 16.3 mg.
* Monosodium Glutamate: Help preserve vaccines and used as a flavor enhancer. Some flu vaccines contain 0.188 mg of MSG, while grape juice can contain 0.258 mg per 100 grams.
* Sodium Chloride: Another name for salt and some vaccine have them to keep them in a state that will not badly affect the cells.
* Sorbitol: Preservative, found naturally in fruits, and also used a sweetener in sugar-free products. MMR vaccine has 15 mg and 1 stick of sugar-free gum has 1.25 g.",2019-08-25 00:17:42

If vaccines are so safe and effective why does the industry need to tell lies? The local news just advertised 1 in 4 measles patients needs to be hospitalized... 

According to

https://www.autism-watch.org/news/lancet.shtml

In 2004, ten of the study's authors issued a ""retraction"" which stated: ""We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient.""

So just how different is that from the studies conclusion? See for yourself - 

""We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue.

If there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine in the UK in 1988...


....We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.""

Isn't the 2004 ""retraction"" Saying the same thing as the study? Nothing was proved. 

The study was published in 1998.. It was retracted a very long time later. Why did it take so long?

Myth: 1 in 1000 measles cases are fatal,4,b8jhk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/b8jhk7/myth_1_in_1000_measles_cases_are_fatal/,32,1554213095.0,"The 1 in 1000 fatality rate from measles is a known calculation error by the CDC. 

It's actually closer to 1 in 10,000 or 0.01% of cases. 

To put it in perspective, 1 in 10,000 is the same probability of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime. (Howstuffworks.com) 

Proof: https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/critical-calculation-error-in-background-information-for-hearing-on-vaccines-save-lives-what-is-driving-preventable-disease-outbreaks-on-march-5-2019/

Prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, “there were an estimated 3 to 4 million people infected with measles in the United States, and as many as 500 related deaths each year,” which is correct. However, this computes to a number of deaths which, at most, is one in 6,000 (3,000,000 divided by 500). More precisely, between 1959 and 1962, about 400 measles deaths occurred among about 4,000,000 measles cases, which results in a one in 10,000 (0.01%) chance of a child dying from measles, not one in 500 or one in 1,000. By comparison, over 23,000 infant deaths occur every year in the U.S. and thus the chance of a child dying in his or her first year of life is currently one in 170 (0.6%)—this is 60 times the risk of a child dying from measles in 1962, a time period when almost every child had measles by age 15.

The reason this calculation error unfortunately commonly occurs is because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes case-fatality rates based on the number of reported cases only. And, since it is estimated that nearly 90% of measles cases are benign and therefore not reported to the CDC, the widely publicized measles case-fatality rate is a 10-fold miscalculation. Such an error has grave public health consequences.

Herd Immunity is it really achievable?,2,azlm88,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/azlm88/herd_immunity_is_it_really_achievable/,17,1552258302.0,"
In 1933, Dr. Arthur W. Hedrich, a health officer in Chicago, IL observed that during 1900-1930, outbreaks of measles in Boston, MA appeared to be suppressed when 68% of the children contracted the virus.3 Subsequently in the 1930s, Dr. Hedrich observed that after 55% of the child population of Baltimore, MD acquired measles, the rest of the population appeared to be protected. It was that observation that formed the basis for mass vaccination campaigns.4

When the mass vaccination campaign for measles in the U.S. began in earnest in the mid-1960s, the U.S. Public Health Service planned to vaccinate over 55% (based on the Baltimore observation) of the U.S. population, and it announced that it fully expected to eradicate measles by 1967. When that didn’t happen, the Public Health Service came up with vaccination rate figures of 70-75% as the way to ensure herd immunity. When eradication was still not achieved at those rates, public health officials jacked up the rates to 80%, 83%, 85%, and ultimately to 90%.

The process by which the decisions to raise the rates is unclear. Was it based on some scientific methodology or assumptions? Or were the decisions simply made because officials felt pressure to fulfill their promises to fully eradicate measles? Did they ever consider pausing and re-evaluating the original premise behind the theory of herd immunity? Or did they trudge on, arbitrarily raising the bar?

Now the rate is up to 95% to achieve herd immunity. But as we see with the continual outbreaks, even at 95% we still do not have full immunity. In China, the vaccination rates are even higher—99%. But there are also still measles outbreaks there.  So is the answer 100%? And what if at 100% you still get outbreaks? We’ve gone from herd immunity supposedly achieved at 55% to herd immunity that is clearly not achieved even at 95%. At what point will public health officials have to confront the possibility that herd immunity may not be the best theory on which to base vaccination policy?

While neither are side will budge on their stance, it makes it all the more difficult for an average person to get an unbiased and helpful outlook towards vaccine products when they are on the fence on whether to get vaccinated, whether it’s for themselves or their children.

Many schools, as well as countries, are making it compulsory that individuals receive Vaccine products at regular intervals for protection against various miscellaneous diseases and infections. Many people, however, are still apprehensive about vaccination.

Before you allow your doctor to inject a concoction of chemicals into their body their bloodstreams you [should be aware of the pros and cons of the vaccine otherwise](https://www.seekandread.com/advantages-disadvantages-vaccinations/) vaccines can be very frightening.

They don’t wish to opt for vaccination without receiving ample information about what these chemicals constitute and whether or not they can have harmful side effects.

I've learned not to challenge her on it because it's gotten me nowhere but she views my beliefs as a personal attack on her directly. She runs a supplements company and has traveled the world teaching about the dangers of vaccines and how it caused my youngest brother to get autism. It's actually the entire basis of why she's a Trump supporter because of his stance on the issue, but that's another issue entirely.

 I know the basis of the argument for vaccines (herd-immunity, diseases are worse etc) but our discussions always boil down to sources and generally what or who to believe. She has the assumption that all CDC sympathetic media or articles are in the pockets of big pharma so they can make all their profits through vaccines. I anticipate this being the crux of the argument following this movie. I don't believe I will break through to her but I do hope to get a better understanding of the issue before I go into 2 hours of full propaganda, then to be bombarded with questions. 

Here's a link of a bunch of articles she views as ""proof"" of what she believes:

http://vaccinepapers.org/

 I've gone through most of it and don't really know what to make of them. There's a lot of prefacing for the studies that are mentioned but like I said, I'm no expert. What do some of you make of these links and/or what valuable information can you give me before going to see ""VAXXED""?

Edit: So I went to see the movie and most of it isn't about what you think. Rather it's about the CDC coverup of the study that showed correlation between autism and the MMR. It's actually really compelling on that front and I urge those of you to go and watch it for yourselves and then come back to discuss what you saw.

"My anti-vax aunt just posted this comment on an article, much more cogently argued than most posts I see, and since I'm not knowledgeable enough to specifically refute anything I was wondering if one of you were.",8,238hku,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/238hku/my_antivax_aunt_just_posted_this_comment_on_an/,22,1397700368.0,"She's a little bit of a conspiracy nut and is super into homeopathy, but she also has a Ph.D. and has written books, so the usual idiocy isn't on display (at least rhetorically). If everything she claims in this post is true, then vaccines are the devil. I know that's not the case, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to refute most of her points, so I was wondering if any of you were.

Here's the post:

""Contrary to the view that non-vaccinators are uneducated fools duped by conspiracy theories, most have taken the time to study the scientific data that show most vaccinations not to be worth the risk. Even the Supreme Court has deemed vaccination to be ""unavoidably unsafe"".
Are you aware that, by law, the CDC sponsors a vaccine injury database called VAERS -- the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. According to VAERS data, over the past 10 years alone, 26,793 people have been hospitalized with vaccine injuries and 2,081 have died. Did you know that 162 young people, mostly healthy teenage girls, have now died after receiving the HPV vaccine?
Did you know that, in exchange for granting legal immunity to vaccine manufacturers, the US government sponsors a vaccine court that awards compensation to families with vaccine-injured children? This court has paid out billions of dollars to families, including for children whose autism was deemed to have been caused by vaccination. Did you know that a 2005 FDA report on the Tripedia DTP vaccine listed many neurological problems as potential side effects, including autism?
Did you know that one of the key studies that supposedly exonerated vaccines from causing autism was authored by Poul Thorsen, now a fugitive wanted for money laundering and fraud? And that, in contrast to what is constantly repeated in the media, there are dozens of studies implicating vaccines as playing a role in causing autism, as well as many other neurological and chronic diseases, including Type 1 diabetes (also on the rise in children)? Did you know that a 2011 study in Germany that compared vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations found unvaccinated children to be far more healthy, with much lower rates of asthma, allergies, ear infections, epilepsy, gluten sensitivities, GERD, anxiety and depression, autism, and dyslexia?
Did you know that a growing number of physicians and immunologists are admitting that vaccination may not be worth the risk? They point out that, in an effort to avoid the childhood diseases (which only 60 years ago were considered beneficial because they triggered true immunity and spurts in child development), we may be causing an increase in chronic disease and a form of disease immunity that is not as strong and longlasting? Did you know that recent outbreaks of childhood diseases among vaccinated children is not due to their ""contamination"" by unvaccinated children or due to loss of so-called ""herd immunity"", but rather, is usually occurring in completely vaccinated populations because their artificial immunity is waning?
Please understand. Parents who wish to forego vaccination for their children are not asking that others follow their lead. They simply want to be permitted to follow their beliefs and not be forced to administer these drugs to their children. Indeed, many of these families already have a vaccine-injured child. Each year, the extremely powerful vaccine industry sponsors media campaigns (like the one we are currently experiencing) whose ultimately goal is to force everyone to become their customers. As a society, we must preserve our human right not to be forceably injected and medicated against our will.""",2014-04-17 05:06:08

Not everybody is able to do everything from home. You should not be told you can’t do ANYTHING unless you get the vaccine, especially when a vaccine is out that protects you from covid therefore putting nobody at risk.

It’s MANDATORY if you want your freedom. And your “ScIeNce” and “BiDeN” and “FaUcI” few days ago was spewing bullshit about wearing masks and blah blah then yesterday, literally one day later, announced no more masks for vaccinated people with absolutely no new science, nothing changed. 

It has nothing to do with not trusting doctors or nurses or medical experts. It has everything to do with politics and the influence they hold over doctors/nurses and medical experts. They will do what Biden says and wants no matter what. They’ve completely contradicted themselves multiple times by taking back something they said cause Biden said opposite.

No vaccine in use today has been used for hundreds of years (though that is probably a good thing)

Also I have already had my first dose

>then you A.) get a medical exemption, or B.) home school.

Medical exemptions are only if you have a documented contraindication, and homeschool is impossible for some people, so yes, requiring vaccines for school does in fact force people to take them, some states also require vaccines for homschool

Comment,1,gsazbvq,,0,1616774534.0,"Best answer I can come  up with:  
Fever and body aches are symptoms from the innate immune system ramping up. 

But if your adaptive immune system (the kind of immunity you want from a vaccine) can take care of the antigens before they trigger an innate immune response, then those symptoms won't be as strong, if they're present at all.

Your immune system isn't *stronger,* *per se,* just you had already started developing the adaptive response and your sister relied more on an innate response. Two weeks after your second shots, you both should have comparable immunity to COVID. :)",2021-03-26 18:02:14

Oh yeah? So if people don't have the chills and a fever **it must mean** their immune system is NOT making the supposed antibodies. Therefore, the people who died, or felt nothing means that the injection didn't work properly.

Sounds very much like the girl who just died from the injection: 

[Ms. Penrod responded that she had her fingers crossed that March 10 would be the last day of her symptoms and it “goes away.” The next day she said she was feeling better “for the most part.” That was the last comment she made on Facebook. Ms. Penrod died on Wednesday, March 17, becoming the youngest victim this blog has covered for all of the experimental shots.](https://thecovidblog.com/2021/03/22/desiree-penrod-25-year-old-connecticut-educator-dead-one-week-after-johnson-johnson-viral-vector-shot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=9edd43552370ae2990a4f3fab5013ee6851076f0-1616626641-0-ASifwr7C4GJTz0MkRFBIeRmRnsS58PVhw8eRRx9lK22ofAXbyR8wILt5cVGSYrNHJGENvOkGOSRMbIPbMVOfVbiLVoP9k_xOs31AVfhwD45uxkv1VzzsMonfhZWAjEBzWzjI-7_9aQnyjZCYTQ_TN-VXtUxaTnG9tjkNwkR-q2QTkB7NsW4ykAwqukYBKS87FHUQ0dBVS5Va0GUWi8vr-ACqw17dgD7nmljI-tEpAZL9uDGneAUg6z_gcjQ6Sggxqic1z81lVINghEqKUggHKKT5qhbhi0-KAVwcAUH1IRU35V6zlfm_Y5jMWSn0zesekAR6ocTi5OuorCLPb2ypm4eU3m2tCltQR-h1kIdNfvTLOe7I4BDNYER2BR0Ol_nws01W5r-RfSZChVLadIplXkr7k_nLn9wH2XtzxsmqTQRZ0VKxRj1SWF46cxu27cfeAUNddMAdUIgqyfzLIvmFu28)

Comment,1,gfttcbw,,0,1607965635.0," 

A study published in 1998 - since discredited and withdrawn - associated the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism. But the concern it sparked among parents lives on.

“People didn't like that they were about to be injected with a biological product they didn't understand, and that was the birth of anti-vaccine movements,” Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC.

Experts say, there’s work to be done to ensure that happens. As distribution of the first 2.9 million doses kicks into gear, public health experts prepare to parse fact from fiction.

“There's a lot of work that has to be done to ensure that the vaccines that come forward that we trust in them, that we trusted the science was done right,” Besser said after months of whiplashed messaging -- and years of systemic inequality. “A casualty of that approach is trust.”

“I think it's okay to be scared,” ABC Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton said. “It's okay to acknowledge that - it means you've been paying attention. But in medicine and science, we have to go on facts, not fear.”",2020-12-14 19:07:15

Comment,1,fx0nt4p,,0,1593971742.0,"Hello. I am a nursing student displaced from clinical rotation due to Covid-19. I found your post regarding your concern relating to your child’s safety with updated vaccines. As you may know, vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity before an individual is exposed to certain life-threatening diseases such as chickenpox or measles. There is a possibility that your child might get measles for an example, but very unlikely. According to the Mayo Clinic, more than 93% of people who get the first dose of MMR develop immunity to measles. After the second dose, about 97% of people are protected. The 2020 Recommended immunizations for children from birth through 6-years old from CDC are linked [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf). According to the CDC, “everyone six months and older should get the influenza (flu) vaccine every season.

The argument that there is a genetic component to autism is not by itself a proof that vaccines cause autism.

 Argument X:  ""It is also often argued that unvaccinated autistic people prove autism is not caused by vaccines""

I often argue the fact the people unvaccinated for MMR  get autism at  about the same rate as people vaccinated for MMR is good evidence that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.  The argument X above appears to be a misrepresentation of that argument by less intelligent people on reddit.

When vaccines are introduced, tests are done to see if they are safe.  They don't test for every single disease in the book.  In general, tests were not done for autism specifically in the distant past.

 Andrew Wakefield wrote a research article claiming the MMR might be associated with autism.  The article was analyzed and Wakefield was discredited and eventually lost his license.

At this point there was no reason to do further analysis scientifically on the subject.  There was no reason to think that the MMR vaccine caused autism.  Safety research on vaccines does not do analysis on every disease in the book.

However, with many vaccine opponents spreading false claims that MMR vaccine cause autism,  a large expensive research project was performed to show that MMR vaccine is not linked to autism.

  
There have not been large expensive research projects to prove every single vaccine does not cause autism.  There are also a thousand + other diseases we could study if there was money enough.  Similarly, tests could be done to see what correlations there are between every drug and food we take with every disease, but there is just not enough money for this.",2020-05-08 16:26:32

There are a lot of incentives to jump through hoops with any vaccine that ""works"" well enough in studies and is feasible to produce.

The fight to be ""first"" will be more important then waiting for the safest and most efficient vaccine (guess where the money is).

This also includes political willingness to say ""this is good enough, spread it"". 

So proper vaccine scientists warn that the temptation to approve **any** vaccine will probably be an issue.
Also, there are many new technologies being used for this vaccine, some of them never before used for vaccine development in humans.

This is a 36 subject study. It's too short and doesn't offer certainty. Either way, will discuss it again.


You missed this paragraph I guess, that the data is not showing a clear causation. 

> ""A second issue is that clearly not enough time has elapsed since the switch to aP to draw definitive conclusions about the resumption of cycles of B. pertussis incidence. While the data appear most consistent with asymptomatic transmission from aP vaccinated individuals, it may be many years before enough time has elapsed to be able to rule out this hypothesis.""


Also other disclaimers:

>Our model does not explicitly account for evolution of the B. pertussis bacterium [7, 56] — a factor which may play a large role in the epidemiological dynamics of B. pertussis. For example, it has been posited that B. pertussis has adapted to vaccination in several European countries. Mooi et al. (2001) identified genetic changes between pre- and post-vaccination strains of B. pertussis [8]. Despite this evidence, including evolution would merely increase the number of individuals susceptible to both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection and would yield exactly the opposite pattern of population genomic variation than seen empirically.



________________________________________________________________
The aP vaccine (acellular pertussis) is reliable for kids especially, somewhat similar to the rotaviral vaccine and maybe the meningococcal one too, because it offers immunity for a few  critical years, when kids are small and vulnerable. Unlike the whole cell pertussis vaccine, which gives a longer and sturdier immunity.

Nobody expects these vaccines to be efficient and create immunity per life. The same with tetanus and diphtheria. You have to get boosters to be actually protected for longer periods of time! Otherwise your antibody count will become super low and you become susceptible to the infection AND maybe becoming a carrier. Sure, not the case of tetanus, but the case of diphtheria. pertussis...

Why? Because with the aP vaccine, immunity is not stimulated enough, as there are less antigens in it to ""irritate"" the immune system and create enough antibodies. Hence you basically become unimmunized. Just like unvaccinated persons. 



This was observed in a trial for animals too. And by this, we get back to your previous ideas that unvaccinated kids are not that much of a danger. They are though, because they become even a bigger reservoir of infection.

>>""However, Merkel notes that there was a “startling” difference in acellular-vaccinated animals: “After they were infected, they became colonised and remained colonised longer than unvaccinated animals. Although they weren’t sick, they were carrying the bacterium in their airways.” When these animals were co-housed, they were able to infect other, unvaccinated, animals.

>>A similar pattern was seen with whole-cell vaccinated animals, but they were able to clear the infection within two weeks — much quicker than the acellular-vaccinated animals. “To a large extent, this can explain the increase we are seeing in cases of pertussis,” says Merkel.""

Either way, the conclusion was ok and mentioned that the more there are vaccinated, just like with polio, the less risk of contracting a disease if you have a large percentage of the population vaccinated. It's called herd immunity! And possible eradication. Look at polio, it still can be transmitted through feces, for a while after getting the vaccine. Yet in so many countries it's been eradicated.

Also, the problem is here that both the study you linked and the one I linked, failed to mention the antibody count. They're just mentioning waning immunity, which is not enough for a conclusion. 

This remains my point of argument, to what you said: you're not immunised,  or properly immunised anymore if you manage to colonise a bacteria you're vaccinated against. Aka: you need the booster.",2020-03-23 11:47:00

In response to Warfel et al., Domenech de Cellès et al.

Comment,6,fkxirg4,,0,1584629030.0,"1.) The movie they cited as their source, “Vaxxed”, was written by Andrew Wakefield. He is a former UK doctor who was hired by a group of parents to find a link between vaccines and autism. He published a study finding the link in the highly respected medical journal the “Lancet”. It was later found that he falsified the results of his study, and also performed very unethical and invasive tests on children with autism to “prove” his findings (think unnecessary spinal taps and other painful procedures). His was the first, and I believe only, article to be retracted in the Lancet in all its years of publication. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and ability to continue practicing medicine in the UK. No doctors, in any country, have ever completed a study that replicated his results. An important factor of scientific studies is they need to be repeatable. If nobody else is getting the same results, his study is suspect regardless of the ethics of it (but that’s a huge deal anyways) I would be HIGHLY skeptical of anything that has his name on it.

2.) The movie Vaxxed is only showing one “side” of the story, if you can call it that. It’s meant to scare people and to convince them that vaccines are bad. It isn’t a sound source because it’s heavily biased and does not present all the information, only the information that supports their narrative.

3.) Vaccine injuries are a real thing. However, they are also incredibly rare. I am not a doctor, or medical professional in any capacity, so I don’t have hard science for you. But look at the number of people who have been fully vaccinated and compare that to the number of people who have vaccine caused injuries. My entire life, 99% of the people I know are fully vaccinated, and not a single one of them had any impairment attributed to vaccines. I’d do some research into the actual chances of vaccine injury. But I’m almost positive that the chances of a vaccine injury are significantly smaller than the chances of injury from other routine or necessary/life saving procedures that we don’t bat an eye at (think surgeries and the like)

4.) The hole in the logic of anti-Vaxxers that I’ve never heard them answer is this: if you break an arm, where are you going to go? Answer: the doctor’s. They wouldn’t think twice about it. I know anti-vaxxers who have rushed their children to the doctor for a high fever. However, they also claim big pharma is a conspiracy and trying to hurt you. If the vaccines aren’t safe, how can anything the doctor says/does be trusted? Either they are in on the conspiracy or they are dumb enough to be taken in by it, and either way how can you trust them? Also, the FDA approves the vaccines, and they also approve the other meds you might take/a doctor might prescribe you. How can you trust ANY of that if the vaccines are a huge conspiracy? You’re better off staying away entirely if that’s the case.

5.) The ingredients in vaccines sound scary, sure. I wouldn’t trust myself to mix a vaccine safely. However, I am not a doctor. I didn’t spend years studying medicine, and then following strict procedures and countless peer-reviewed and tested studies to have the know-how to make vaccines. Just like I wouldn’t trust myself to wire a house, because I have no experience, but I would trust an electrician. Or how I would trust a cardiologist to perform open heart surgery on me but I wouldn’t trust my husband because he isn’t a medical professional.

6.) On their whole “ingestion vs injection” thing; broccoli is totally safe to ingest. We recommend people ingestion broccoli as it’s very good for you. We do not recommend people injecting broccoli into their bloodstream. Again, I’m not a doctor, but injecting broccoli into your body will kill you. Should we get rid of broccoli?

7.) Vaccines seem unnecessary, but it’s because they work. Vaccines stop the spread of dangerous and even deadly diseases. When enough people vaccinate, it protects the vulnerable populations (elderly, very young, immunocompromised, and those who for one reason or another cannot receive vaccines). The disease cannot spread, causing it to effectively die out, or at least prevents it from becoming a pandemic. This whole Coronavirus thing is actually a good illustration of how bad a pandemic can be and how beneficial these vaccines are. Smallpox, measles, heck even the flu, all used to tear through communities and kill/injure a lot of people. Modern medicine helps, but the vaccines keep it from spreading like wildfire in the first place. When was the last measles epidemic? Or the last smallpox outbreak? We vaccinate for those, and while a case of measles or two might pop up every now and then, we aren’t shutting down cities because of an outbreak.

You have to take a step back from all this stuff being thrown at you and ask- if even a small fraction of them are correct, why is it pediatricians, epidemiologists, and their various member organizations still recommend their use? If the answer is ""because big pharma,"" then you will have to reassess how much drug companies make off of vaccines. Hint: it's not a whole lot.

Just a random study: that first one, let's say. 

>Four to 12 days post 12 month vaccination, children had a 1.33 (1.29–1.38) increased relative incidence

So, that works out to a 33% increased risk of whatever it is they're measuring, with a range of 29% to 38% increased risk (with a 95% confidence limit). Sounds like a lot! 

>Ten to 12 days post 18 month vaccination, the relative incidence was 1.25 (95%, 1.17–1.33) which represented at least one excess event for every 730 children vaccinated. 

So.... one ""excess event"" for 730 vaccinations, or about 0.14%. That's.... not very much. And how many were bad enough to require hospitalization?

>There were non-significant increases in hospital admissions.

Secondly, many of the cited studies are going on about mercury. Thimerosal- the compound containing mercury used to preserve vaccines- has not been used in childhood vaccines for years, long enough that we should have seen a diminution in the rate of autism would that mercury was responsible. As it stands, all routine vaccines for use in those under the age of 6 [do not contain thimerosal.](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines)

>Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater odds for autism diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month of life.

This raises the possibility that some issue at birth is associated with both autism and postponement of vaccination, the including of 3 year olds who may not have been diagnosed yet, along with the use of ""parental report of autism diagnosis"" rather than medical record could also possibly create issues

This study was also done before mercury was removed from hepatitis B vaccine in the US, so besides the potential for confounding variables it is looking at a vaccine with a no longer used preservative (still used in certain flu shots, but not hepatitis vaccine). I don't think this is an entirely conclusive study

**STUDY #3:** This is comparing different countries, which is just asking for confounding variables, I'm not even sure I want to bother reading through a study that I can tell from the abstract is so inconclusive.

Also, the only author is  journalist who runs an antivax group

**STUDY #4** is a case report of an unusual event and is inconclusive because such case reports can't determine if the deaths were a coincidence or not

**STUDY #5** Is of an unsafe vaccine that was withdrawn from the market over safety concerns and has now been replaced with a different version [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#vaccines)

This study also uses number of pediatricians in a state as the measure of access to care, which is ridiculous, as finance, transportation, population, geography, ect also affect access to care

Also, the author is an economist, not a doctor

**STUDY #7** Just says a whistleblower said vaccines cause autism, a lot more info is needed to know what is going on here

**STUDY #8** is interesting but jumps to conclusions, as the info provided is insufficient to establish causation, it may be that an overactive immune system causes both the autoantibodies and the abnormal immune response to measles vaccine, rather than that the vaccines causes the autoantibodies. And if the vaccine does cause the autoantibodies, then measles itself likely also would, and may present a greater risk than the vaccine

**STUDY #9** is once again based on temporal correlation and comparison of different countries, see #6 and #3 for why that is bad

Comment,0,fijl0ok,,0,1582452969.0,"**TL:DR It takes time to read multiple studies, but I read though most of the first one and it looks pretty good, it suggests that around 1 in 168 kids have a side effect leading to an ER visit or hospitalization caused by the first dose of MMR and chickenpox vaccines, although most were just ER visits without hospitalization**

**I will look into the rest of them in coming days (or hours), but looking through all 39(!) will take some time**

Analysis of the first study (sorry it's so long, science is just complicated sometimes): The authors appear to be from legitimate institutions, and the methods of the study look legit, they found that among kids who go to the ER within 28 days after the 12 month vaccines in Ontario, more of them went to the ER between 4-12 days after vaccination than when to the ER on days 20-28, and this was statistically significant, using a legitimate definition of statistically significant (95% CI, and p-value <0.0001)

This suggests that that vaccines are causing kids to go to the ER between 4 and 12 days after vaccination, which is consistant with the expected timeframe for reactions to live vaccines such as the MMR and chickenpox vaccine, both of which are given at 12 months

The most obvious form of bias would be to compare time periods of different lengths, but they are comparing a 9 day period to a 9 day period, so no issue there

Another potential issue with a study like this study is that the rate of ER visits on days 20-28 is assumed to be non-vaccine related, and used as a control, so any vaccine related ER visits in this period would not only be missed but would contribute to a lower estimate of the number of day 4-12 ER visits that are attributable to vaccines, this bias would actually make the study underestimate the dangers of vaccines, but I don't know that it was a major issue based on the graphs provided

The fact that they vaccine related ER visits had almost the exact same severity score as the none vaccine related ones might suggest that the ""vaccine related"" ER visits and non vaccine related ones, are for the exact same conditions, meaning that none of them are actually vaccine related (or that they all are, but this wouldn't explain the ER visits right before vaccination). However, there was no increase in facial injuries in the period of increased ER visits after vaccination, suggesting that the increase was actually do to different conditions, ie, they were actually vaccine related. Vaccine related and non-vaccine related ER visits could be the same average severity if this is a threshold at which parents take kids to the ER, and both vaccine related and non vaccine related ER visits are rarely more serious than this threshold

The increase in ER visits after 18 month vaccinations (which include a second dose of MMR and chickenpox) was little to none, which is consistant with the fact that once you have had the 1 dose of a live virus vaccine you are usually vaccinated against side effects of subsequent doses, and this suggests that the increase in ER visits after the 12 months vaccines is either due to the live vaccines (MMR and/or chickenpox), or one of the non live vaccines that is given at 12 months but not at 18 months, although the timing 4-12 days after vaccination is more consistant with a live vaccine",2020-02-23 12:16:09

Comment,1,fgtleg0,,0,1581106046.0,"> Their immune system is burdened as well as purged of natural disease detourants.

I don't think there is any evidence for this, and I struggle to imagine any biologically plausible mechanism that would cause this. 

Vaccines are not especially burdensom to the immune system. On the contrary we encounter a dozen novel antigens per day, and at any given point our immune systems are in the process of combating 1000+ different insults (though the vast majority are mostly harmless like pet dander or pollen). 

Moreover, today's vaccination schedule is far less insulting than the one our parents went through. Today's children get more overall needle sticks, but smaller doses each time, and there are fewer novel antigens in said vaccines. In the 1960-70s they had no good way to determine which antigens to target to provoke an immune response, so they basically used brute force. Some vaccines had hundreds even thousands of antigens like the old Pertussis vaccine. Probably only a handful were relevant, but they couldn't isolate them, so they just gave you the whole load. Today we're much better at isolating the relevant ones. 

I saw a paper about this a few years back, IIRC a child born in the 2010s will be exposed to about 150 novel antigens through the CDC recommended vaccination schedule, a kid born in the 1980s probably got 3000, and in larger doses (but fewer shots). We probably get 20,000+ per year naturally anyway. As such, the insult from vaccinations is not that unusual, and in fact, far less significant than actually getting the flu or measles. I don't think there is any evidence that vaccination makes people ""softer"".

While hygiene theory suggest growing up in a sterile environment is a bad thing, there is no evidence that surviving horrible illnesses somehow makes you stronger. In fact, I'd wager the opposite. A serous measles infection for example, can royally screw with your immune system for years. 

As to your question, I can't imagine how getting routine flu and TDAP shots would make you more susceptible to something like SARS or nCov. 

I'd guess modern epidemics are the result of habitat destruction via industrial agriculture, and  reckless slaughter practices, and increased human mobility. The 2014 West Ebola outbreak was not unusual in any biological way, the only thing that changed was that modern Africa is surprisingly well connected with significant flow of goods and people, whereas 1970s Africa was isolated and most Ebola outbreaks were easily contained.",2020-02-07 22:07:26

The first coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s, and are one of several that cause the common cold. You've almost certainly had a few coronavirus infections over the course of your life. SARS, MERS-CoV and the new nCov-2019 are unusually dangerous examples, but there is no evidence whatsoever that they were engineered.

I don't see how vaccines could have anything to do with these recent spillovers either. Putting domesticated food animals in close quarters with wild animals and humans is a receipe for disaster.

The [HeLa cell line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa) due to the controversy surrounding the family's lack of compensation.

They are extensively used in cancer research, so overall a good thing to have, but does the family of Ms. Lacks deserve a cut of this profit?

Anyway, two other cell lines (both from aborted fetuses from the 1960s) are commonly used in vaccine research and development. 

So the answer is, kind of. They aren't buying fetuses from Planned Parenthood and grinding them up to add to the vaccine. But some vaccines were developed using these cell lines. Note that many drugs also make use of such cell lines, it'd be very hard to avoid them all. Cell lines like these are one of the foundations of modern medical research.",2020-01-31 20:19:39
Comment,1,fg40ao1,,0,1580493461.0,"No, there are no aborted fetal cells in vaccines.  
> The production of a few vaccines, including those for varicella, rubella, and hepatitis A, involves growing the viruses in human cell culture. Two human cell lines provide the cell cultures needed for producing vaccines; these lines were developed from two legally aborted fetuses in the 1960s. These cell lines are maintained to have an indefinite life span. No fetal tissue has been added since the cell lines were originally created.
Some parents are concerned about this issue because of misinformation they have encountered on the Internet. Two such untrue statements are that ongoing abortions are needed to manufacture vaccines and vaccines are contaminated with fetal tissue.  

https://www.immunize.org/askexperts/vaccine-safety.asp  

The cell lines came from abortions due to congenital rubella syndrome resulting from a 1964 rubella epidemic.  
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/503157  
The vaccines that were developed because of these two cell lines have prevented an estimated 10+ million deaths.  
The rubella vaccine prevented over 633,000 miscarriages in the U.S. alone, and countless more across the globe, and it has prevented tens of millions of clinical health issues in children.

Different vaccine, different indications and schedules. Obviously insurance system will affect antenatal care and screenings, which affect the risk/benefit analysis for something like the Hep B vaccine (which, again, is not the same as the vaccine you're mentioning in the UK). It's just a different healthcare system. That there are different immunization schedules isn't particularly surprising or even necessarily meaningful.

>Aren't babies particularly sensitive when they are first borne?

The vaccine is tolerated fine, so I dunno what else this would imply that's worth addressing.

>I was thinking that it makes more sense not to give unneeded vaccines or medications on the first day of life just to improve compliance

It's not ""unneeded"" on day 1 any more than day 60 or day 600. You derive more benefit from earlier vaccination by definition. It also improves compliance because you already have started the schedule, informed the parents, and can test the mother. 

>although if there are testing errors I can understand this

That and screening insufficiencies, etc. 

>Why are you always so hostile?

Why are you always quick to make sweeping and uninformed judgments? I've just got no patience for such nonsense, and if you have any intellectual honesty then you'll grit your teeth, take the lumps where you've earned them, and be better for it.

Comment,10,fe5fvum,,0,1578868932.0,"> Honestly it is wired that they are giving this vaccine on day 1

To belabor the point that this is a pretty vapid comment:

>>Universal HepB vaccination of all infants beginning at birth provides a critical safeguard and prevents infection among infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers not identified prenatally (e.g., in situations where the mother was not tested or when testing, interpretation, or transcription errors occurred).

>>Approximately 88% of commercially insured women and 84% of Medicaid-enrolled women are tested for HBsAg during pregnancy (27). In one study of a large health system in northern California, 93% of HBsAg-positive pregnant women were tested for HBV DNA (28). Most (94.9%) infants born to infected women receive recommended prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth (29). 

>>Universal HepB vaccine birth dose coverage, defined as 1 dose of vaccine administered by 3 days of life, is 71.1% (30), an increase from 50.1% during 2003–2005 prior to revised ACIP recommendations for the birth dose before hospital discharge (31), but below the Healthy People 2020 target of 85% (32).

So we have [three good reasons](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm). First, through failure to identify Hep B positive mothers through two different mechanisms, and for compliance reasons (the baby *is* right there, after all).

Now the UK does it differently. They have both a different healthcare/insurance system, and they also use a hexavalent vaccine rather than monovalent Hep B vaccines. That's two levels of incongruent comparisons, and no particular substantive reason to delay other than if you support lower compliance rates and increased testing failure risks.

But, hey, glad you see no issue with it.",2020-01-13 00:42:12

Comment,3,fc5csk7,,0,1577453572.0,">Claiming that industry-funded studies aren't biased. This is simply not true https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20614424. When citing studies, make sure they don't have major conflicts of interest ***IMPORTANT*** This is NOT the most up to date evidence of the flu vaccine's effectiveness, I only cited this as a source for the fact that industry-funded studies are biased. Here are more up to date reviews:

This isn't remotely in line with FDA approval standards. I also don't see how the Cochrane review in any way justifies your opinion here unless you misunderstand what 'bias' is meant in these reviews.

Edit: So I missed what you're likely referring to with this link, the warning at the bottom of this (and only this) Cochrane review. This review itself has no particular issue with or statement against industry funded studies and, of course, included many. The actual study you're trying to refer to is [this one](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b354) by another study author on these Cochrane reviews you've cited. Notably these reviews are in line with reported influenza vaccine efficacy which is common, that being ~45%. 

I've taken one example from the 2009 review you have meant to cite as an example (see Wongsurakiat 2004 in Table 2): 

>>Study was conducted over one year. Conclusions support recommendation of annual vaccination (one dose is sufficient in adults, as strong response has been observed). Authors note that vaccine effectiveness has been shown, even if it was possibly administered too late (in region where study was carried out peak incidence of influenza occurs usually in May).

All totally in line with their results. They have strong evidence of an effect even with a later administration. Seasonal homogeneity isn't uncommon, so this is a bizarre complaint against strong statistical results and completely 'concordant' summary in the conclusion. In fact, the delayed administration of the first dose still being effective is totally in line with rapid waning of influenza vaccine efficacy. Plus the patients had a second booster dose which is not normally recommended for adults, further maintaining higher titer levels into the next season. On a cynical reading, one might think that patients sick in May were included even though vaccination began in June. In reality, given the study was conducted for a full calendar year which simply rolled over a month after 'normal peak' season, this means that vaccination began in June of 1997, included May 1998 (peak season) and went through October 1998. 

>>Comment: though authors state that effectiveness is shown for influenza related ARI only, and not influenza, they recommend vaccination for patients with COPD. 

Because it demonstrated statistically significant reduction for influenza related ARI or, as referred to in the study, ILI. 

>>This means recommending vaccine though it is not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations. 

Misleading or incorrect wording. The Cochrane authors are distinguishing ILI and laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection (causing the pathology 'influenza'). As the original authors state, viral propagation from infection was only possible in 10% of those patients with ILI presentation. The paper does *not* demonstrate a *lack* of efficacy, but only *fails* to demonstrate *presence* of efficacy for lab confirmed influenza. Yet considering the serology confirmed increase in antibody titer, strong reduction in ILI, and lack of effect against non-influenza ARI, this is a terrible mischaracterization of the study and its conclusions. Usually there is no ability to distinguish between flu-ARI and non-flu-ARI. However in this case other viral agents were confirmed, giving much higher confidence in proper ILI designation. 

>>In addition, lack of comment on community viral circulation and vaccine content and matching make verification of effectiveness against ARI impossible.

I have no idea what the Cochrane authors are saying here. Wongsurakiat et al *do* comment on circulating virus among the community, *do* comment on vaccine content, and *do* make a matching verification. The predominantly circulating type A flu was H3N2 at the time, of which the vaccine component was stated to be on target, and of which the majority of confirmed flu in the study was confirmed to be type A. moreover, they confirm specific titer increases for the study subjects in line with well-known protective level thresholds. And, finally, the authors *don't* suggest the vaccine has effect against ARI--that is to say all acute respiratory infections--and instead say it is true for *only* influenza-ARI. 

This being a prime example in their table of discordance...I'm extremely disappointed. The Cochrane authors seem to dispute the sensitive nature of COPD patients to airway exacerbations and wholly ignore this supreme risk factor which any responsible clinician must weigh (risk) against perceived benefit of the vaccine (reward). See this excerpt:

>>All the unvaccinated patients with moderate-to-severe
COPD who were hospitalized because of influenzarelated ARI required mechanical ventilation. One of
these patients with severe COPD died because of
ventilator-associated pneumonia. In contrast, none
of the vaccinated patients required mechanical ventilatory support because of ARI related to influenza
virus infection.

Now, these results might not be statistically significant, but they aren't evidence of it being ""not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations"" like the Cochrane authors state. Are the Cochrane authors *really* disputing the idea that influenza vaccination proved effective against ILI? Or are they just harping on the lack of distinction between ILI and lab-confirmed influenza? Because one of those questions has an obvious and practical answer for clinicians, and the other is an academic or philosophical exercise. I'm either missing something big, or this is a huge oversight on the part of the Cochrane authors. Cochrane authors are humans the same as all the other study authors. To conclude that industry funded studies are completely unreliable is not 'concordant' with the Cochrane authors themselves.",2019-12-27 15:32:52

https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccinesCause/comments/dwacb7/the_myth_of_herd_immunity/

Pro vaccine choice individuals are the ones calling for more study and scientific progress. It is usually the ones that call for more vaccination that have the hubris to believe the science is settled and we know everything there is to know about the human body and the immune system.  

It is the ones against vaccine choice that have the arrogance to demand everyone follow what they believe regardless of the individuals hurt along the way. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and that the nation state should be allowed to tell an individual what to inject into their body are fascist ideals.

Fascism - anti-intellectual, anti-democratic, individual interests are subordinated to the good of the nation, forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism, regiments industry, commerce, etc., emphasizes an aggressive nationalism and often racism. 

AKA taking away an individual’s right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects and subjecting them to mass experimentation for “the good of the nation” while really just backing the ever growing pharmaceutical industry and suppressing any information that contradicts their interests. 

So even if you don’t agree don’t force your ideals on others.

They are experimenting on people with vaccines (ex: from vaccine insert: “vaccines have not been tested for mutagenic or carcinogenic effects on pregnant women” yet we give vaccines to pregnant women anyway.

Shingles is an infection with the same virus as chickenpox, and can only happen if you have been exposed to the virus at some point in the past, and are not immune, it is usually a reactivation of the virus decades after chickenpox (no you are not contagious for all those decades) but shingles has been know to occur directly following exposure to the virus, and as a result of the vaccine virus as well",2019-11-26 00:10:05
Comment,5,f8q75on,,0,1574713172.0,">Why is this mom excited about the chicken pox?

Probably because chickenpox is more serious for adults than children, and is a virus that can build up long term immunity, so she is hoping that by getting chickenpox now will prevent a more serious case of chickenpox when the kids are older

>Is it not dangerous?

Serious complications are not common, 1 in 300-500 chickenpox cases requires hospitalization and 1 in 60,000 results in death [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications)

>My kids are both fully vaccinated (4 and 2 years old), are they protected?

No guarantee, the vaccine is not 100% effective, and the second dose isn't given until age 4-6, so it is still best to keep your kids away from sick people until they are no longer sick. According to the CDC a person with chickenpox is no longer contagious 24 hours after that last new spot appears, which shouldn't be more than a week or so after the start of symptoms

>Arent your risk of getting shingles greatly increased if you have had the chicken pox?

Yes, it is pretty much impossible to get shingles if you haven't had chickenpox or a chickenpox vaccine

>I am pregnant but had them as a kid, am i protected?

This is probably a question for your doctor, but there is no guarantee, and live vaccines such as chickenpox aren't recommended for pregnant women, so avoid exposure to infected people especially while pregnant, as harm to the fetus is possible [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications)

>If anti vaxxers get excited that your body builds natural immunity after having the disease, isnt that what vaccines do for your body except your never ""sick""?

Yes, (well you can still get a little sick) but antivaxers are concerned about combinations of viruses in one vaccine, multiple vaccines at the same them, and chemical additives (although most of the chemical additives of concern are only used for vaccines against things that you can't build up immunity to from catching them)",2019-11-25 22:19:32
Comment,2,f8q5w5h,,0,1574712610.0,"So I’ll answer this as best I can, I am neither a doctor or an anti-vaxxer so anyone feel free to correct me/add on if I’m wrong:

The mom is excited about her kids getting chicken pox because basically once you’ve had chicken pox you’re unlikely (or immune, not 100% sure which) to get it again. Before the chicken pox vaccine it was common to try to get your kids exposed to chicken pox young because I believe the older you are the worse it is. So basically she’s trying to prevent her kids from getting it worse by exposing them young. Which would make sense except we have a vaccine so they never have to get it at all.

The point of vaccines isn’t just to protect you. It protects immunocompromised people who will her can’t get the vaccine, or can but are otherwise at risk of getting sick anyways. Two of my siblings are on immunosuppressants for other conditions they have. Despite being fully vaccinated, they get sick super easy and when they get sick it’s way worse because their immune systems are shot. So, like I said before, before the vaccine it made sense to expose your kids young to head off a worse infection later. Now, however, there’s no need to encourage the spread of a disease that could be dangerous for certain people groups (immunocompromised, elderly, young children, pregnant women, etc.).

The whole “natural immunity” thing that anti-vaxxers like to tout is not really what they make it sound like. They like to say your body is naturally able to fight off infection/keep you from getting sick. Which is true, to an extent, but when your kid gets chicken pox they don’t have a “natural immunity” to chicken pox. They still got chicken pox. It’s not like your body miraculously protects you from ever getting sick.

If you are concerned about your own health, I’d talk to your doctor. Since you are pregnant you can get sick easier. My personal, NOT MEDICAL, recommendation would be to stay away from your friend/her kids/her husband/etc until the chicken pox completely clears their house. Again, ask your doctor what they recommend, but I think steering clear is the safest bet here since you DON’T want chicken pox and pregnancy at the same time. That sounds terrible! Also remember that just because someone is not showing symptoms does not mean they aren’t carrying the disease. I’m not 100% sure how chicken pox spreads, so again please please talk to your doctor, but if your friend isn’t sick she may still be able to spread the disease to you.

As far as shingles goes, I think maybe having chicken pox as a kid makes you more likely to get it but I don’t think you have to have had chicken pox to get it. Again, not 100% sure here so hopefully someone smarter is able to fill this in!

Of course low efficacy doesn’t make them more harmful. But it does change the risk benefit analysis. 

Of course not all ILI are flu. Only about 3% - 9% of suspected flu cases are actually flu. The flu vaccine is less effective because as you admit “strains cannot be matched every single year. Of course that a virus with increased mutagenic shifts will not be matched for the vaccine every year.” So all the ILI are used to promote flu vaccines but vaccines may reduce 10-30% of 3-9% of “flu” cases. And these number are before factoring in primary and secondary vaccine failure and declining efficacy through repeat vaccination... that’s a low benefit. 

Plus you are now exposed to the risks of vaccines. Autoimmune diseases, GBS, etc

Pregnant women shouldn’t be vaccinated. There being no studies on vaccine safety doesn’t make them any safer. But it does allow officials the ability to claim there is no proof vaccines are harmful... convenient. 

From vaccine insert: “vaccines have not been tested for mutagenic or carcinogenic effects on pregnant women” yet we give vaccines to pregnant women anyway. Also, activating maternal immune system has risks to fetus. Yet they persist in their unjustified claims that it provides some benefit.

Um, no.  What they said was there was a correlation found they just don’t know why the efficacy is lower after repeated vaccination and more study was needed. 

I have smart amazing unvaccinated children. Thank you for asking. 

Vaccine side effects are not rare. They are suppressed. There is a difference. 

Vaccines are labeled “unavoidably unsafe” by the US Supreme Court and were protected from judicial oversight through legal channels (National Child Vaccine Injury Act in 1986), this took away legal channels for discovery and safety review. This happened because so many people said vaccines were injuring their loved ones.

The population at large is told adverse reactions are rare and not to worry about them. So Drs and patients alike do not know the risks and do not see a connection between their health issues and the vaccines they’ve received. (The majority of vaccine recipients are too young to tell us if they are experiencing side effects). If no one is looking at or tracking the risks then how can you say they’ve got a safe track record. We are not healthier overall and without a definitive cause for the health concerns it is irresponsible to say definitively that vaccines are not the cause.

Vaccine adverse events 1) compensated in vaccine court: Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, encephalopathy, seizure disorder, death, brachial neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomylites, Chronic inflammatory demyelination, polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD), premature ovarian failure, Bell’s palsy, juvenile diabetes, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, infantile spasms, anaphylaxis, ocular myasthenia gravis, hypoxic seizure.

2) listed on vaccine inserts: Autoimmune diseases, allergies, asthma, eczema, tics, Tourette’s syndrome, ADD / ADHD, autism, speech delay, neurodevelopment disorder, SIDS, narcolepsy.

When an automated reporting system analyzed data reported over a 3 yr period it found that adverse reactions could be 26:1,000 or approximately 1 in 38.

http://healthimpactnews.com/2017/harvard-immunologist-to-legislators-unvaccinated-children-pose-zero-risk-to-anyone/ “A recent study done in Ontario, Canada, established that vaccination actually leads to an emergency room visit for 1 in 168 children following their 12-month vaccination appointment and for 1 in 730 children following their 18-month vaccination appointment (see appendix for a scientific study, Item #5).”

1 in 640 have a seizure from mmr https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles/vrs/

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmrv/mmrv-febrile-seizures.html
“The rate of seizures in this timeframe was 85 per 1000 person-years in the MMRV vaccine group compared to 42 per 1000 in the MMR and varicella vaccine group. This risk was about 2 times higher in children who received the combination shot (MMRV) versus the single shots (MMR and varicella).”

“Approximately 40 cases of death and permanent injury from the MMR vaccine are reported to VAERS annually” and only about 1-10% of adverse events are reported. So that could mean approximately 400-4000 deaths or permanent injuries from the mmr vaccine annually.

“As of March 31, 2018, there have been more than 89,355 reports of measles vaccine reactions, hospitalizations, injuries and deaths following measles vaccinations made to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), including 445 related deaths, 6,196 hospitalizations, and 1,657 related disabilities. Over 60% of those adverse events occurred in children three years old and under.” https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles/vrs/

After automating adverse event reports at Harvard Pilgrim, the developers of this system asked the CDC to take the final step of linking VAERS with the Harvard Pilgrim system so that these reports could be automatically transmitted into VAERS. Instead, the CDC refused to cooperate. As the Harvard grant recipients explained: Unfortunately, there was never an opportunity to perform system performance assessments because the necessary CDC contacts were no longer available and the CDC consultants responsible for receiving data were no longer responsive to our multiple requests to proceed with testing and evaluation. After three years and spending $1 million of taxpayers’ money, the CDC refused to even communicate with the HHS’ Harvard Medical School grant recipients. While HHS generally strongly supports automating public health surveillance systems, when it comes to vaccine safety, the CDC has only supported projects that would limit VAERS to passive surveillance. Automation would improve safety and address many of the long-standing issues and limitations raised by CDC regarding VAERS.37 Capturing “fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events” thirty years after the passage of the 1986 Act is unacceptable – and potentially deadly. https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/whitepapers/VaccineSafety-Version-1.0-October-2-2017.pdf",2019-11-19 03:56:12

1: **AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age.**


No studies on this, doesn't make it less efficient. 

2: **There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns.**

Oh no, who would've thought, you moron, that strains cannot be matched every single year. Of course that a virus with increased mutagenic shifts will not be matched for the vaccine every year. Nobody claimed anything different. That doesn't make the vaccine itself harmful. What the fuck are you on about? Are you doing meth?

As a former epidemiologist, I'm ashamed to read  Jefferson T's  ""review"" about the influenza vaccine. He uses SO FUCKING MANY fallacies. He doesn't take into account even the morbidity or mortality of the flu and claims that not even pregnant women should be vaccinated, because the less you do medical acts on them, the better. That's outrageous and bizarre as fuck. Do we live in 2019 or 1900?

Do you even fucking know how flu pandemics wiped millions of people in 1919? Just look up Spanish flu.

I'm sure those people would rather get a low antibody count from a vaccine, than fucking none. 40% less deaths is better than what happened then.

You said that the flu shot is less and less efficient if you get it every year.

Again, your reading comprehension is out of this world. And that's not good. Cause you don't seem to be having a human brain.

They said:

""Researchers found adults had similar levels of protection if they received the flu vaccine in the current season, the previous season or both seasons. They also found that vaccine effectiveness was 27-41 percent higher for adults who were vaccinated for the first time in the past five years, compared to those who got the vaccine almost every year. She said reasons for the increase in effectiveness is not yet clear and more research is needed to understand how repeated flu vaccination affects the immune system.""

You know what that means, mister scientific method? That means THAT NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND.

SO WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING HARD PROOF, WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE? 


I really hope you don't reproduce and just so you know, logical fallacies don't confirm your bullshit. Yes, science evolves. But vaccines are proof that science also works and it's better to prevent, unlike your claims that drs don't want that, than to treat. Or bury your patients.

Science vs pseudoscience 
https://i.redd.it/04bewq91kxuy.jpg

Scientific progress always takes a long time. Even the now simple concept of hand washing took more than 20 years to catch on and Dr. Semmelweis was mocked and shamed for the notion that Drs may be spreading disease, suffered a nervous breakdown and died due to mistreatment in an asylum. This is how we reward people who question the status quo and seek progress, especially when it may bring to light that Drs may be unwittingly harming patients by following that status quo. 

Pro vaccine choice individuals are the ones calling for more study and scientific progress. It is usually the ones that call for more vaccination that have the hubris to believe the science is settled and we know everything there is to know about the human body and the immune system.  

It is the ones against vaccine choice that have the arrogance to demand everyone follow what they believe regardless of the individuals hurt along the way. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and that the nation state should be allowed to tell an individual what to inject into their body are fascist ideals.

Fascism - anti-intellectual, anti-democratic, individual interests are subordinated to the good of the nation, forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism, regiments industry, commerce, etc., emphasizes an aggressive nationalism and often racism. 

AKA taking away an individual’s right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects and subjecting them to mass experimentation for “the good of the nation” while really just backing the ever growing pharmaceutical industry and suppressing any information that contradicts their interests. 

So even if you don’t agree don’t force your ideals on others.",2019-11-17 02:55:04

Comment,-1,f7obsbr,,0,1573924758.0,"Lol. These are quotes from the studies. And the studies are trying to figure out why the flu vaccine causes this decrease in efficacy. Feel free to read them and let me know your interpretation. 

As far as group immunity...
Note the “no decline in transmission” below 

According to a Cochrane review the flu vaccine IF it has the correct strains circulating reduces the likelihood of catching the flu from 4% if unvaccinated to 1% if vaccinated. A 3% risk difference. So not much of a benefit there. Also the study concluded that there is no evidence that the flu vaccine affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission. The CDC combines pneumonia rates with flu rates to estimate the number of deaths from the flu, creating extremely exaggerated numbers to push the flu vaccine when the flu vaccine doesn’t reduce rates of pneumonia. And the insert actually lists pneumonia as a possible side effect.

And...

The Myth of Herd Immunity
The Myth of Herd Immunity leads us to believe that unvaccinated populations will bring back epidemics of deadly diseases. This myth also makes us believe that:
1. Unvaccinated children are a threat to society and
2. Unvaccinated children pose a risk to vaccinated children.
I’ll tackle this whole discombobulated mess of a myth in one post, through the research, knowledge, science, & expertise of a doctor, a pediatrician, & a neurosurgeon.
What are we told?
* We often hear statements from public health officials like “Clusters of unvaccinated children are not only in potential danger themselves, but are also a threat to the herd immunity”.
* Authorities argue that parents should vaccinate their children to protect society as a whole from epidemics.
* According to public health officials, “parents who reject vaccines don’t consider the effect of their child on the rest of society”.
* We are told that for the shots to work, everyone must play along. And parents who decline the vaccines, are somehow reaping the benefits from those who are vaccinated.
What is truth? 
Dr. O’Shea, in his book: “Vaccination is Not Immunization” explains:  “Do not make the error of many pediatricians or journalists who talk about herd immunity as though it refers to the immunity that proceeds from a large group of people being vaccinated. The calculated deception behind this common misnomer is that if you don’t know what herd immunity is, you’ll buy their illusion: that the unvaccinated child can take advantage of the herd who have been vaccinated. This is well though-out propaganda. True herd immunity is a term which indicates that a disease has burned itself out within a population, as with plague, smallpox, typhus-every infectious disease in history. The herd has become immune. Natural selection. It has to do with nature, not with manmade vaccines. Don’t be fooled again”
Dr. Palevsky (board-certified pediatrician) explains: “This whole concept of herd immunity is very interesting, because we were taught that herd immunity occurs because a certain percentage of a population gets an active illness. Therefore by a certain percentage of getting the active illness, they impart a protection onto the remaining part of the population that has not gotten the illness yet. And so the herd that is getting the illness is shedding the illness and protecting those who have not gotten it.""
In vaccine science, we are extrapolating or concluding that if we vaccinate a certain percentage of people, we are imparting protection on those who have not been vaccinated. And that has NOT been shown to be true, because the true herd immunity in theory is based on an ACTIVE DISEASE, and we know that despite what we’re taught, vaccination does not mimic the natural disease.
Thus, we cannot use the same model of herd immunity in a natural disease in the vaccination policy. This does not stop the press, every single year.
The entire concept of herd immunity fails to acknowledge that there is a life cycle of the viruses and the bacteria all on their own, and that what turns them on and off may have nothing to do with the percentage of people who have been infected.
By failing to include that viruses have a life cycle, and that they are in relationship to other organisms and to us, we are missing the main point. It is preposterous to think that a child who is vaccinated no longer carries the bacteria or the viruses that they have been vaccinated against. That is the whole point of vaccines.
So Once You Are Vaccinated, You Are Part of the Herd. Right?
Dr. Blaylock (board certified neurosurgeon) explains: 
“In the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason is that naturally acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. Vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity. But there was one major problem: Vaccine-induced immunity lasts for only a relatively short period…
This is why they quietly began to suggest  boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.
Then they discovered an even greater problem: The boosters were lasting for only two years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those that they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.
That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. We all were told for over 70 years that vaccine immunity lasts a lifetime. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given.
What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. At least 50 percent of the population has been unprotected for decades.
If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95 percent. Yet we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50 percent or less of the population having vaccine protection.
Herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades, and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations”.
Where is the Logic?
Take Pertussis (whooping cough) Dr. Palevsky explains this very well:
Do children vaccinated with the pertussis vaccine somehow stop carrying pertussis bacteria in their airways simply because they’ve been vaccinated? NO
Do pertussis vaccines stop vaccinated children from transmitting the pertussis bacteria to other people? NO
Do pertussis bacteria disappear from society once vaccination rates are high? NO: Vaccination rates for pertussis have no impact on whether the pertussis bacteria are in the air or not, or whether or not we breathe them in. The presence of the pertussis bacteria, and the exposure to them, are in no way affected by vaccination status or vaccination rates.
Do unvaccinated children, because they are unvaccinated, carry the bacteria in their airways, which vaccinated children are somehow no longer believed to be carrying because they’ve been vaccinated? NO
Do unvaccinated children transmit the pertussis bacteria to other children by the mere fact that they are not vaccinated? NO: Air is air. Air is free to breathe. We breathe in whatever is in the air. And, vaccinated and unvaccinated children are equally exposed to breathing in pertussis bacteria.
Anyone who poses as science the idea that unvaccinated children pose a threat to the population because they are unvaccinated and are more likely to transmit a disease to the rest of the population, is misleading you, promulgating myth, and inaccurate. Vaccination with the pertussis vaccine does not exonerate anyone from carrying the pertussis bacteria, or prevent them from being exposed to the bacteria.
Unvaccinated children do not walk around carrying secret viruses and bacteria that no-one else has. An unvaccinated child with measles has no greater chance of spreading measles than a vaccinated child with measles would.",2019-11-16 19:19:18

Vaccines are labeled “unavoidably unsafe” by the US Supreme Court and were protected from judicial oversight through legal channels (National Child Vaccine Injury Act in 1986), this took away legal channels for discovery and safety review. This happened because so many people said vaccines were injuring their loved ones.

The ethical argument against double-blind placebo controlled studies is nonsense. In drug trial (vs biologics aka vaccines) a sick individual would be denied a drug that could potentially save their life in order to have a true control to determine an accurate basis of side effects for risk assessment. And in vaccine trials they will not only use a different vaccine as the “placebo”, they will also use a solution with the aluminum adjuvants in place of a saline solution. How is this beneficial to anyone? How is it more ethical to expose someone to the most questionable ingredient in the vaccine with no benefit of generating any kind of antibodies? It’s total nonsense. 

Aluminum does cross the blood brain barrier and accumulate in the body. 

The study “Flarend et al.”  was a study of 6 rabbits over 28 days that looked at the absorption and elimination of Al adjuvants. 

The study admits we do not understand Al adjuvants in the body. “The disposition of aluminum containing adjuvants after intramuscular administration is not understood.”

The study detected Al adjuvant in the brain, kidneys, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and heart.

Most of Al still in the system after 28 days: “The cumulative amount of aluminum eliminated in the urine during the 28 days of the study was 6% of the Al hydroxide and 22% of the Al phosphate adjuvant dose. Aluminum from both adjuvants was still being excreted at a steady rate at day 28.”

For Al hydroxide, about 100-5.6% = 94.4% of the aluminum remained in the rabbits after 28 days. For Al phosphate, about 100-22% = 78% remained in the rabbits after 28 days. We do not know the elimination rates of the Al still in the body after 28 days or what happened to the Al that travelled to the brain and other organs.

“We previously showed that poorly biodegradable aluminum-coated particles injected into muscle are promptly phagocytosed in muscle and the draining lymph nodes, and can disseminate within phagocytic cells throughout the body and slowly accumulate in brain. This strongly suggests that long-term adjuvant biopersistence within phagocytic cells is a prerequisite for slow brain translocation and delayed neurotoxicity”

using double blind, inert-placebo, randomized studies is the gold standard in science for a good reason.
there is only one way u can get around using such safety studies, which is the use of a prior tested medication or vaccine in a double blind, randomized, inert-placebo controlled study, so that the safety of this medication has been proven prior properly, to be used as a control group in an non inferiority type of study, this however was never the case for any vaccine.
and i don't care what a WHO expert panel says, the WHO being a huge part of the pro vaccine push, despite refusal to do proper studies, so why should i listen to an appeal to authority, to an agency, that literally throws oil in the fire of fear of people against people, who are educated and refuse to vaccinate.
and i literally linked 2 sources in the last comment, that showed u, that aluminium in vaccines is an acute exposure.
""An aluminium adjuvant in a vaccine is an acute exposure to aluminium""
and i linked u a 2nd source showing, that extreme levels of aluminium are found in the brains of autistic people:
""aluminium in brain tissue in autism""

so i assume u haven't even read them?
question: if we find the neurotoxin aluminium in the brains of autistic people, where does it come from according to u? could it be, that vaccines are the source? oh wait it is the highest source for it looking at the first paper doing some basic math, the first infanrix hexa vaccination being 3x the load of aluminium to the 56 day old baby, as they got their whole entire prior 55 days of life through breastfeeding, the math is clear, the science is clear.
Doesn't cross the brain's barrier, doesn't accumulate, doesn't do... whatever you and the others claim today.
skeptical raptor calls it pseudoscience, yet we got a clear delivery way and source and we find it in the brain at extreme levels, so it CLEARLY crosses the blood brain barrier, how about u read the sources i give, before u state your believe of the opposite?

Comment,6,f6ytj1b,,0,1573296624.0,"First of all, double blind studies need large masses of people and it's unethical. Like, if you give a placebo to some infants that could be saved from tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis etc, would you do it? What if they die from that disease? 

https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/94056/9789241506250_eng.pdf;jsessionid=D19837B6AAF49E362E4297F66EBB53E4?sequence=1

Example for the rotavirus vaccine

>A key ethical aspect considered when adopting the placebo-controlled design was that the risks of withholding rotavirus vaccine could be (and were) mitigated by rehydration counselling and regular check-ups. 


Another problem with that is that these vaccines were proven over and over again that they are effective. And there are multiple methods to do that without risking someone's lives. Like testing for antibodies. It's simple, it's effective, it doesn't cost that much, especially not a life!

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157320/

>Against this backdrop, the WHO Department of Ethics and Social Determinants convened an expert consultation to provide recommendations on the use of placebo controls in vaccine trials in cases where an efficacious vaccine already exists. 

See? It's not like the dropped the vaccines on the market and then let them do damage and hope for the best. The vaccines were extensively tested anyway, so yeah, now maybe they can have some placebo tests done, if it doesn't risk... let's say, an infant's life. But they don't even need to do that. They just have to use an unvaccinated cohort (and they can find that for sure, either because of poverty, lack of vaccines, etc) and compare the results.

>While this paper focuses specifically on the use of placebo controls, similar considerations apply to open designs in which a placebo is not used, but an unvaccinated control group is included.


Another great article.

For the other thing: https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/aluminum-and-vaccines-its-time-to-clear-up-the-pseudoscience/

First it was ""mercury"" or thimerosal, which is a salt of mercury. Now it's aluminium. They're just moving goal posts. 

The dose makes the poison. From a 0,5 ml dose of a vaccine, aluminium will not be in such a high quantity and it will be eliminated from the body within 72 h and wouldn't be able to travel anywhere, since it's injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. 

In fact, it stays there, irritates the skin, draws white blood cells to it and then will help create a higher immune response than a vaccine without it. That's it. 


Doesn't cross the brain's barrier, doesn't accumulate, doesn't do... whatever they claim today.

Comment,1,f6njdph,,0,1572992793.0,"It's funny that. In England & Wales from 1901 to 1970 sudden and inexplicable deaths in under 4 year old's was a rarity with just a few cases per year. In 1961 the first measles vaccine was trialed here. 1961 saw a higher than ever reported morbidity of measles and a higher than average mortality, the 5 years prior to this we weren't even seeing 100 deaths per year which was quite the achievement given at the start of the century we were seeing up to >13,000 in a year, in 1961 we saw 152 deaths. 1962 they seemed to step back. No reports of any tests and the numbers showed it. Case rates plummeted, as did mortality. 1963, they officially star to use the first measles vaccine. Again, we see morbidity and mortality rise:

Year	Cases	Deaths

1956	160,556	    28

1957	633,678	    94

1958	259,308	    49

1959	539,524	    98

1960	159,364	    31

**1961	763,531	   152**

1962	184,895	    39

**1963	601,255	   127**

**1964	306,801	    73**

**1965	502,209	   115**

**1966	343,642	    80**

**1967	460,407	    99**

If you look at the history of measles mortality, you see a pattern develop - low then high. Over the decades, mortality bombed. No NHS, no antibiotics, no vaccine, just improved living and better understanding. When you look at 1956 to 1960 and compare that to how the drop was constant up until this point, there was nothing in nature that should have allowed mortality to rise the way it did, the **only** difference during these times was the measles vaccine. Mortality was almost double what it should have been during these times.

In 1968 an *improved* vaccine is released and measles rates settle. Uptake is slow, however, the interesting thing is the rise in sudden and inexplicable deaths in children under the age of 4 from 1970. Prior to 1970, there were 2, maybe 3 if any deaths in under 4's which couldn't be explained.

**Sudden and unexplained deaths in under 4's:**

**1961 -** 0

**1962 -** 0

**1963 -** 0

**1964 -** 1

**1965 -** 1

**1966 -** 0

**1967 -** 0

**1968 -** 1

**1969 -** 2

**1970 -** 51

**1971 -** 250

**1972 -** 454

**1973 -** 581

**1974 -** 600

**1975 -** 634

**1976 -** 626

**1977 -** 690

**1978 -** 736

Yes. Have you considered the possibility the dose in vaccines can make the poison in some individuals? Both aluminum and thimerosal are acknowledged as neurotoxins.

Read on:

>  Dr. Verstraeten “…we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes. First, for two months of age, an unspecified developmental delay, which has its own specific ICD9 code. Exposure at three months of age, Tics. Exposure at six months of age, an attention deficit disorder. Exposure at one, three and six months of age, language and speech delays which are two separate ICD9 codes. Exposures at one, three and six months of age, the entire category of neurodevelopmental delays, which includes all of these plus a number of other disorders.”

> Dr. Weil, pg. 207: ""The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant. The positive relationships are those that one might expect from the Faroe Islands studies. They are also related to those data we do have on experimental animal data and similar to the neurodevelopmental tox data on other substances, so that I think you can't accept that this is out of the ordinary.

Comment,1,f5sddg1,,0,1572424099.0,"**Ethylmercury**

Ethylmercury (sometimes ethyl mercury) is a cation composed of an organic CH3CH2- species (an ethyl group) bound to a mercury(II) centre, making it a type of organometallic cation, and giving it a chemical formula is C2H5Hg+. It is one of the metabolites of thiomersal (thimerosal or sodium ethyl mercuric thiosalicylate), which is used as a preservative in some vaccines. The term ""ethylmercury"" is also sometimes used as a generic term to describe organomercury compounds which include the ethylmercury functional group, such as ethylmercury chloride and ethylmercury urea.

>I am saying that just because most people don't have autism doesn't tell you about what causes autism, only changes, or lack thereof, in the number of people with autism can tell you this

You originally said that OP claimed a rate of ASD independent of change or what not was enough to determine if vaccines had any effect on ASD. OP never claimed this, and you never explained why one might presuppose a static rate of ASD was reasonable to begin with.

And *that* was what I was trying to tell you. ASD rates have changed independent of vaccines. You cannot look at one point in time and conclude anything. You insisting that OP said that is bad faith, since there is nothing to indicate that's what they meant, you never asked them about it, and there are plenty of reasonable interpretations on the table.

I think you've now tried to walk it back to a more general rebuttal of something that, well, nobody suggested was the case to begin with.",2019-09-25 15:35:16

""....the CDC (a drug company that owns over 52 patents for vaccines) says they're 'safe and effective'"" is an interesting assertion.

[This site](https://vaxopedia.org/2018/05/19/does-the-cdc-own-any-patents-on-vaccines/) is useful for viewing this assertion in context. Just a quick recap:

The CDC buys a lot of vaccines from manufacturers for distribution. Aside from perhaps a few extraordinary and obscure experimental vaccines, the CDC does not mass-manufacture vaccines.

The CDC does hold patents; more specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services holds these patents. Most of these technologies involve the vaccine *technology,* and ostensibly allow the government to control intellectual property such that what researchers have developed on the public dollar don't end up being capitalized by industry, where the price would get marked up.

Comment,12,f0xafxx,,0,1569026582.0,"So a couple things. 

They didn't link fluoride to reduced IQ in children, they found that doses higher than drinking water (and slightly above EATING toothpaste, which it's clear not to) can act as a teratogen and damage the child during a pregnancy. 

Since your post asks about Mercury, I'll explain that a little more. Elemental mercury isn't the same as organic mercury. If your only chemistry background was in high school or not even then, it's understandable that you may not fully understand this. 

Methanol, HOCH3, is extremely poisonous to humans on low doses. Ethanol, HO(CH3)2, so off by just a saturated carbon, is drinking alcohol. Not safe, but not poisonous at moderate doses. That's just a couple atoms. 

A better example might even be oxygen. Breathing in the oxygen you do, diatomic oxygen, O2, is MUCH different than elemental or ionic oxygen. One let's you live, the other rips apart DNA. That's just a couple electrons. 

The best example, as always, is table salt. Sodium in it's elemental,uncharged, +0 state explodes in reaction with water. Chlorine in it's elemental, uncharged form is an incredibly poisonous gas. But guess what? When these are combined, or for specificty's sake, one electron is removed from each, they become a flavorful, harmless salt. That's one electron that separates an explosive sodium with a dissolvable sodium ion. 

In that same spirit, the mercury that used to be in vaccines wasn't in elemental form. It was in this compound.
 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Thiomersal.svg/1200px-Thiomersal.svg.png

That looks pretty complex, right? The way molecules are structured doesn't allow for atoms to ""be themselves"" when in a compound. Mercury here (in it's +2 state) can't do what we all know elemental mercury, or even worse, methylmercury, can do. It can't just break free and be a dangerous atom. The resonance forms from the ring as well as the heavy metal salt component make it a completely unique compound; not just the sum of its parts. It's much more complex than that. 

If that's too confusing, I'm sorry. That's the way it is. Hope it helps",2019-09-21 03:43:02

Comment,1,f0pj72j,,0,1568835813.0,"Um, well I was pretty unbiased looking into the issue... at first I found the low hanging fruit by the CDC and was leaning towards them being more beneficial than not. Then I started going through Suzanne Humphries lectures on her youtube page and many other documentaries and lectures, that's when the scales tipped in the other direction. 

Then I learned that there's never been done a double blind, placebo study of fully vaccinated verses fully unvaccinated. Honestly, I wouldn't vaccinate until a major such study is done by independent researchers. It could be done ethically by doing it on a voluntary basis. Or doing it an a large number of monkeys or what have you. 

Plus the HHS's requested report on how to improve VAERS finding that less than 1% of vaccine related injuries, including death, are even reported. The CDC ignored the results and are invested in the public perception of the vaccination schedule as being very safe. 

Those last two things made me decide not to vaccinate. I'm not really against them though, people can get them as much as they like, I'm merely against authoritarian-vaxxers, those who would mandate vaccination on the unwilling through coercion.",2019-09-18 22:43:33

>The occurrence of encephalopathy after whole-cell pertussis vaccination has been an issue of intense scrutiny and debate. Often cited are the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study conducted in UK from 1976 to 1979 and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report (1994). The initial findings of the National Encephalopathy study were that acute encephalopathy occurred at a rate of 1 per 310,000 to 5,300,000 doses (95% CI 54,000 to 5,310,000). Subsequent investigations and follow-up of the affected children then cast some doubt on these initial findings and demonstrated no increase in the rate of death or other sequelae after a DTwP vaccine (Edwards et al., 2008). However, despite these revised findings this has been an area of ongoing controversy. In 1994, the IOM concluded that “the balance of evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between DTwP and chronic nervous system dysfunction in children whose serious acute neurological illness occurred within 7 days of a DTwP vaccination”. This may imply that the vaccine rarely may trigger such an event in an individual who may be predisposed to develop such a condition because of an underlying abnormality. The IOM committee concluded that the evidence is insufficient to indicate either the presence or absence of a causal relationship between DTwP vaccine and permanent neurological damage (Cowan et al.,1993). More recent studies do not confirm an association between DTwP and acute encephalopathy. A population-based case-control study has evaluated the association between serious acute neurological illness and receipt of whole-cell pertussis vaccine, given as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTwP) vaccine. The estimated odds ratio for children with encephalopathy or complicated seizures was 3.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 15.2). The study concluded that there was no statistically significant increased risk of serious acute neurological illness in the 7 days after DTwP vaccine exposure (Gale et al., 1994). A retrospective case-control study performed at four health maintenance organizations by examining children aged 0 to 6 years who were hospitalized with encephalopathy or related conditions determined that cases were no more likely than controls to have received a DTwP vaccine during the 90 days before disease onset. When encephalopathy of known etiology was excluded, the odds ratio for case children having received DTP within 7 days before onset of disease was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.45-3.31, P = 0.693) compared with control children. The study concluded that DTwP vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of encephalopathy (Ray et al., 2006).",2019-09-16 05:11:34

To care about a websites name and not about the facts is a great and obvious way of avoiding the things you don't want to hear, by not listening to the opposing side, by not entering an open minded state, by avoiding reading what you might find uncomfortable and cognitively difficult.

I as an anti vaxxer, always look at CDC, FDA, vaxyourkids.org, who, getvaccinated.org, immuniseyourkids.org, vaccinesaresafe.org, vaxopedia.org and the guardian.


Because I'm not afraid to find things out, I want to believe as many true things and as little false.. And not looking at opposing sites isn't going to get me to that point.

measles, pertussis, and any of the literally hundreds of vaccine-preventable illnesses are killing and permanently injuring people every second of every day, right now, and it's getting worse. 

Why do you think that outbreaks of measles are concentrated around neighborhoods with a low % of immunizations, and incidence of outbreaks increases with a decrease in the vaccination rate?

Like, I would genuinely like to know why you think that might be. It's something that's happening right now in the real world.

Well only if of course you believe that Andrew Wakefield was wrong. And even if he was, it still doesn't discredit my argument because that would be a fallacy of containment.. because something contains a false piece of information, doesn't mean that the rest is also false.

It's just an easy way for you to ignore and to rationalize not being reasonable.

Summary)

Well, many many scientists believe vaccines aren't safe, and believe there's alot of crap going on in the realm of vaccination and in the medical community and the media community.

You know why there aren't many scientists who are against vaccines? Well, because when they are, they get fired, and awesome now we don't have to call them scientists any more.

The greater that lifespan is the more prone we will be to cancer as we exceed previous lifespan limitations. That's just how genetics and DNA work. As you age your DNA becomes more damaged, when it becomes more damaged it will be more error prone. The more error prone the more likely cancerous mutations are to develop. Unless we can find a way of fundamentally changing our DNA and how it operates that's just the way the cookie crumbles as we age. 

Thanks for explaining what cancer is.. I I'm having a difficult time working out what points you think you made here.

Cancer doesn't just come from ageing, you clearly have no idea what cancer is. Many children have cancer.

>Autism was just an example to show that statistics can be misleading without given proper context i'm not going to go into whatever that nonsense of a last statement was.

Comment,1,esfyuxg,,0,1561938530.0,">autism has increased greatly in the past couple decades” well yeah no shit because now we understand it better and are able to identify and address it better than they could more than 40-50 years ago.

But not only autism; encephalopathy, meningitis, brain damage, SIDS, chronic illnesses, autoimmune disorders, diabetes, and organ failures, especially in kids, have also drastically risen.

to credit the entire growth of 50 fold to mere diagnosis and understanding is pretty shoddy

>It is more cancer though, technically, since more people are able to live longer there’s going to be more people with cancer - which increases rate of cancer in a population. So someone can skew some statistics and say “vaccines lead to a higher percentage of people with cancer” or “vaccines lead to a higher chance of cancer” which is true, albeit an out of context statement, because people live longer = more older people with cancer = higher cancerous population = higher chance of becoming cancerous.

I guess nothing can rise anymore, because it all just comes down to more people living..

when the efficacy of the flu shot varies from year to year, you realize the entire population would have to get the shot 3x to ensure a  >50% immunized base that many say is needed for herd immunity of the flu because it has a low Ro (assuming 25% efficacy rate which is not implausible)",2019-06-12 04:36:26

But basically, when you inject a vaccine, some cells called memory cells will be stocked in the ganglyon with a print of the antigene that a virus can wear, so if the virus come again with the antigene, your body will be able to recognize it and kill it. But those memory cells don't live forever. Some can live up to 10-15 years but that's all.

And by ""handful"" exactly how many cases are you suggesting happened in Europe following Pandemrix vaccination compared with China/Taiwan? You keep using spin despite your apparent disdain for it.

>No cases in Europe like that. They were all associated with the vaccine, not the virus.

Only Pandemrix, and there is no current hypothesis in which the vaccine was a risk factor *outside of* viral antigen (not specific to the vaccine) or other concurrent environmental factors (e.g. H1N1 infection, GAS).

>About 1300 cases. All vaccine, no virus.

That's not even remotely true. You're literally just bullshitting:

>> [A biologic mechanism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30122647) to explain this observation has not been established, but it has been postulated that an interaction involving the immune responses to administration of Pandemrix-AS03 and infection with wild-type pH1N1 virus could be a contributing factor [20]. This would explain the apparent presence of an association in Finland, Sweden and Norway where wildtype virus circulated coincident with the vaccination program, whereas no association was seen in Ontario where wild-type virus was no longer circulating at the time of the vaccination program.

You also are greatly exaggerating the numbers of those with NT1 narcolepsy relative to the overall risk. It really isn't known exactly how and why some people who received Pandemrix even with the associated HLA did or did not develop narcolepsy. Over 11 million doses have been distributed total.

Comment,3,emf7fqr,,0,1556901956.0,">No more AS03 being used in Europe right now, though, is there?

Well, duh, it's an experimental adjuvant that isn't used in any vaccine excepting emergent circumstances and clinical trials. It's also not used in the US, either, because there isn't a need for it. It's just used for pandemic vaccines in emergent circumstances.

>You can spin it how you want. An interplay of vaccine and genetics really screwed these people.

There's no spin, just fact. But since you live and breathe off spin and lies, I'm not surprised you recognize a different consistency here. You've gone waaay off the beaten path because you don't know shit about immunology, ASD pathogenesis, or infectious disease. So you found that one discontinued vaccine increased the risk of narcolepsy/cataplexy in a subset of genetically disposed individuals and you're trying to run hard with it.

It has nothing to do with childhood vaccines, nothing to do with ASD, and likely nothing to do with AS03. That there was an association with the vaccine is incidental and due to the fact that it was, apparently, able to recapitulate the natural tendency of some circulating pandemic 2009 H1N1 strains to increase rates of narcolepsy/cataplexy. To repeat: **circulating H1N1 virus was correlated with increased narcolepys/cataplexy rates prior to vaccine campaigns in several countries**.

Cryptic antigen mimicry which is the presumed mechanism of action is likely at play in several diseases. If we can determine the B or T cell epitopes with cross reactivity these can be removed from the vaccine. As it currently stands, these epitopes were never determined. Nevertheless, you will still run to such edge cases with relatively small impacts on small incidence rates because this is how you behave when you've been cornered. You repeat this pattern over and over, much to the amusement of onlookers. 

>Maybe you should go back to playing with next year's flu vax formulation.

Comment,4,emeuiyr,,0,1556893689.0,">Yawn.

In your sleep deprivation it seems you completely forgot your operating hypothesis: differences in ethnicity ultimately lead to a differential ASD diagnostic outcome.

Congratulations! We have [data](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/addm-community-report/differences-in-children.html) on that. It doesn't support your hypothesis--that non-white ethnicities have higher ASD diagnosis. So we keep piling up the implausibility. You have to now plausibly explain why higher antibody titers or other unknown immune response factors to a vaccine lead to differential ASD diagnosis among races. And *then* you have to explain why in *your* link there is no difference among genders--which is a hallmark for differential ASD diagnosis. Oops, guess ya didn't read that after all.

So, yes, I'm curious: how would race, but not gender, impact ASD development according to the above link when this 1) doesn't fit epi data on ASD diagnosis among ethnicities; 2) doesn't fit gender epi data on ASD diagnosis? But we know the answer: you haven't thought about it and you don't care. You just bring up some random hair-brained idea to deal with your cognitive dissonance. The pattern has borne itself out twice in this thread alone.

>I'm ""caucasian"". I've also found out I have fairly recent genetic ties to subsaharan Africa.

Excellent--so this would *not* be a problem with the Danish study, as genetic factors can be cryptic and not adequately accounted for by simple race-binning. High five!

>That was a pretty big fuckup too, wasn't it? One in five europeans carrying a dormant gene for narcolepsy that the vaccine adjuvant just happened to trigger?

Uh oh, sounds like you don't know much about AS03, MF59, or the Pandemrix situation and that this is just a random distraction from the actual conversation you've so thoroughly lost. No worries--I'm used to having to fill you in on everything.

The Pandemrix association with narcolepsy appears to be a cryptic antigen site, not related to any of the adjuvants used in the pandemic vaccines. Read the [multi-country](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6404226/) assessment which looked at several AS03 and one MF59 vaccine, as well as the safety assessment of [AS03](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19305225?via%3Dihub). 

Also, you don't seem to understand how genes work. The vaccine didn't trigger a ""dormant gene"". The virus, which the vaccine recapitulated specific antigenic sites, can apparently trigger autoimmune reaction in a small subset of people among a specific HLA type. I recommend hitting up wikipedia on [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) so you can get that under your belt.

The diversity is representative of the Danish population. So you concede there is no cause for concern among the Danish population. Excellent. Now we just need to walk you from this bizarre racial angle.

If you think race is a better predictor of autism risk factors than sex, smoking during pregnancy, family history of ASD diagnosis, head circumference at birth, weight at birth, method of birth delivery, and, vaccination status...then yous an idiot. 

But you don't *really* think that, it's just the convenient way you try to remedy your cognitive dissonance. We get it. 

>We can draw NO universal conclusions from this study.

Not even your own logic supports this ridiculous claim. In the most conservative interpretation, even if we assume your hypothesis about race to have *some* merit, we can now rule out all medical, non-race, factors from influencing ASD development in association with vaccines. And by extension based on the Danish population we can confidently declare that anyone of caucasion descent also has no differential response, either.

This is called the *Post hoc ergo propter hoc* (Latin for *after this, therefore because of this*) fallacy. Just because the two things happened in order doesn't mean that one caused the other. For example, most pregnancies happen in people who have previously watched television. Does this mean that watching television gets you pregnant? Of course not.",2019-04-26 08:58:29
