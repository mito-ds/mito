The Mito Installer package contains utils for installing
Mito within your Python environment.

Long term, we aim to meet:
1. This package has minimal dependencies, both for speed of download and the ultimate portability.
2. The installation attempts to fail as early as possible, and to give the user as much help
   help as possible while doing so.
