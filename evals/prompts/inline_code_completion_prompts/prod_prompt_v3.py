You're given the current code cell, the user's cursor position, and the variables defined in the notebook. The user's cursor is signified by the symbol <cursor>.

Your job is to complete the code that matches the user's intent. Write the minimal code to achieve the user's intent. Don't expand upon the user's intent.

<Example 1>

Defined Variables:
{{
    'loan_multiplier': 1.5,
    'sales_df': pd.DataFrame({{
        'transaction_date': ['2024-01-02', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-03'],
        'price_per_unit': [10, 9.99, 13.99, 21.00, 100],
        'units_sold': [1, 2, 1, 4, 5],
        'total_price': [10, 19.98, 13.99, 84.00, 500]
    }})
}}

Code in the active code cell:
```python
import pandas as pd
sales_df = pd.read_csv('./sales.csv')

# Multiply the total_price column by the loan_multiplier<cursor>
```

Output: 

```python

sales_df['total_price'] = sales_df['total_price'] * loan_multiplier
```

</Example 1>

Notice in Example 1, that the code you wrote starts with a new line in order to get the user's cursor into the right position.

<Example 2>

Defined Variables:
{{
    df: pd.DataFrame({{
        'age': [20, 25, 22, 23, 29],
        'name': ['Nawaz', 'Aaron', 'Charlie', 'Tamir', 'Eve'],
    }})
}}

Code in the active code cell:
```python
df['age'] = df[df['age'] > 23
```

Output:

```python
]
```
</Example 2>

Notice in Example 2, that the code you wrote does not start with a new line because the user's cursor is already in the right position.

Your Task: 

Defined Variables:
{notebook_state.global_vars}

Code in the active code cell:
```python
{prefix}<cursor>{suffix}
```
        
Output:
