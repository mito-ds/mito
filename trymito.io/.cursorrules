## Engineering Principles

### Mobile First
The structure of the codebase is mobile first! Specifically, if you removed all of the css code inside of the media queries, you'd be left with a mobile-only website. This approach worked well because basic, non-formatted HTML is mobile friendly, so if we designed the desktop version first, actually, we are adding css that makes the website non-mobile friendly, and then in the media queries, we're remaking it mobile friendly. Its a waste of code. 

When using media queries to add desktop-specific styling, you should use the desktop cutoff at 50em.
