# ![Mito Logo](https://www.trymito.io/_next/image?url=%2FMito.svg&w=128&q=75) Mito Monorepo 

Mito is a spreadsheet that lives inside your JupyterLab notebooks. It allows you to edit Pandas dataframes like an Excel file, and generates Python code that corresponds to each of your edits.

Mito aims to be the _first_ tool in your data science toolkit and supports:
- Point-and-click CSV and XLSX import
- Excel-style pivot tables
- Graph generation
- Filtering and sorting
- Merge (lookups)
- Excel-Style formulas
- Column summary statistics
- And much more!

Mito is an open source tool (look around...), and will always be built by and for our community. See our [plans page](https://www.trymito.io/plans) for more detail about our features, and consider purchasing Mito Pro to help fund development.
